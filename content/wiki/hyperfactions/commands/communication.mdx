# Communication Commands

HyperFactions provides private chat channels for faction and alliance communication.

## Chat Mode Toggle

HyperFactions uses a **toggle mode** for chat channels. Instead of prefixing each message, you switch into a chat mode and all subsequent messages go to that channel until you switch back.

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f c",
      description: "Cycle chat mode: normal -> faction -> ally -> normal",
      permission: "hyperfactions.chat.faction"
    },
    {
      command: "/f c f",
      description: "Switch to faction chat mode (alias: /f c faction)",
      permission: "hyperfactions.chat.faction"
    },
    {
      command: "/f c a",
      description: "Switch to ally chat mode (alias: /f c ally)",
      permission: "hyperfactions.chat.ally"
    },
    {
      command: "/f c off",
      description: "Switch back to normal/public chat (aliases: /f c normal, /f c public)",
      permission: "hyperfactions.chat.faction"
    }
  ]}
/>

**How it works:**
- Run `/f c` with no arguments to cycle through modes: normal, faction, ally, then back to normal
- Or specify a mode directly: `/f c f` for faction, `/f c a` for ally, `/f c off` for normal
- Once in a chat mode, all regular messages you type go to that channel
- Your current mode persists until you change it or log out

<InfoBox variant="info">
Your current chat mode is displayed in your chat prompt. Look for the [F] or [A] prefix to know which channel you're in.
</InfoBox>

### Chat History GUI

Faction and alliance chat messages are logged and can be reviewed through the chat history GUI, accessible from the faction menu. This allows you to catch up on messages you may have missed while offline.

## Quick Reference

| Command | Effect | Permission |
|---------|--------|------------|
| `/f c` | Cycle chat mode | `hyperfactions.chat.faction` |
| `/f c f` or `/f c faction` | Switch to faction chat | `hyperfactions.chat.faction` |
| `/f c a` or `/f c ally` | Switch to ally chat | `hyperfactions.chat.ally` |
| `/f c off` or `/f c normal` or `/f c public` | Switch to normal chat | `hyperfactions.chat.faction` |

## Chat Formatting

Messages in faction/alliance chat have distinct formatting:

### Faction Chat
```
[F] [YourFaction] PlayerName: Your message here
```

### Alliance Chat
```
[A] [YourFaction] PlayerName: Your message here
```

The exact format may vary based on configuration and HyperPerms integration.

## Chat Configuration

Chat formatting can be customized in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "chat": {
    "enabled": true,
    "format": "[%faction%] %player%: %message%",
    "tagDisplay": "prefix",
    "tagFormat": "[%tag%]",
    "noFactionTag": "",
    "priority": 100,
    "relationColors": {
      "own": "#00FF00",
      "ally": "#00FFFF",
      "enemy": "#FF0000",
      "neutral": "#FFFF00"
    }
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Switching to Faction Chat for a Battle

```
/f c f
```
Now all your messages go to faction chat. Type normally:
```
Everyone get online! We're being attacked!
Defend the north wall!
```
Only your faction sees these messages.

### Coordinating with Allies

```
/f c a
```
Now all your messages go to alliance chat:
```
We'll attack from the north. You take the south.
```
All players in allied factions see this.

### Returning to Normal Chat

```
/f c off
```
Your messages now go to public chat again.

### Quick Cycling

```
/f c
```
Cycles to the next mode. Run repeatedly to move through normal, faction, ally, and back to normal.

## Permission Summary

<PermissionTable
  title="Chat Permissions"
  permissions={[
    {
      permission: "hyperfactions.chat.faction",
      description: "Use faction chat",
      default: "false"
    },
    {
      permission: "hyperfactions.chat.ally",
      description: "Use alliance chat",
      default: "false"
    }
  ]}
/>

## HyperPerms Integration

When HyperPerms is installed, faction information can appear in regular chat:

```
[FactionName][Rank] PlayerName: message
```

**Placeholders available:**
- `%faction%` - Player's faction name
- `%faction_rank%` - Player's faction rank (Leader/Officer/Member)
- `%faction_power%` - Player's current power

<InfoBox variant="info">
HyperPerms integration is automatic. Just install both mods and the chat formatting works.

## Strategic Communication

### When to Use Faction Chat
- **Coordinating actions** - "Everyone claim the eastern chunks"
- **Private discussions** - Internal faction matters
- **Emergency alerts** - "Enemy at the base!"

### When to Use Alliance Chat
- **Joint operations** - Coordinated attacks or defense
- **Sharing intel** - Enemy movements and power levels
- **Event coordination** - Multi-faction activities

### Communication Tips
1. **Be clear and concise** - Quick messages in combat
2. **Use consistently** - Members should check faction chat
3. **Respect privacy** - Don't share faction chat outside
4. **Coordinate roles** - Designate a shot-caller

## Chat vs Other Communication

| Method | Scope | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Faction Chat | Faction only | Internal coordination |
| Alliance Chat | All allies | Multi-faction coordination |
| Local Chat | Nearby players | Public communication |
| Private Message | One player | Direct communication |
| Discord | External | Out-of-game planning |
