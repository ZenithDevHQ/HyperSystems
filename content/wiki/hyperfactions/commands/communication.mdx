## Quick Reference

| Command | Audience | Permission |
|---------|----------|------------|
| `/f c <message>` | Your faction only | `hyperfactions.chat.faction` |
| `/f a <message>` | All allied factions | `hyperfactions.chat.ally` |

## Chat Formatting

Messages in faction/alliance chat have distinct formatting:

### Faction Chat
```
[F] [YourFaction] PlayerName: Your message here
```

### Alliance Chat
```
[A] [YourFaction] PlayerName: Your message here
```

The exact format may vary based on configuration and HyperPerms integration.

## Examples

### Coordinating Defense

```
/f c Everyone get online! We're being attacked!
```

Only your faction sees this message.

### Planning with Allies

```
/f a We'll attack from the north. You take the south.
```

All players in allied factions see this.

### Quick Messages

```
/f c base
/f c help
/f c gg
```

Short messages for quick communication.

## Chat Permissions

<PermissionTable
  permissions={[
    {
      permission: "hyperfactions.chat.faction",
      description: "Use faction chat",
      default: "true"
    },
    {
      permission: "hyperfactions.chat.ally",
      description: "Use alliance chat",
      default: "true"
    }
  ]}
/>

## HyperPerms Integration

When HyperPerms is installed, faction information can appear in regular chat:

```
[FactionName][Rank] PlayerName: message
```

**Placeholders available:**
- `%faction%` - Player's faction name
- `%faction_rank%` - Player's faction rank (Leader/Officer/Member)
- `%faction_power%` - Player's current power

<InfoBox variant="info">
HyperPerms integration is automatic. Just install both mods and the chat formatting works.
</InfoBox>

## Strategic Communication

### When to Use Faction Chat
- **Coordinating actions** - "Everyone claim the eastern chunks"
- **Private discussions** - Internal faction matters
- **Emergency alerts** - "Enemy at the base!"

### When to Use Alliance Chat
- **Joint operations** - Coordinated attacks or defense
- **Sharing intel** - Enemy movements and power levels
- **Event coordination** - Multi-faction activities

### Communication Tips
1. **Be clear and concise** - Quick messages in combat
2. **Use consistently** - Members should check faction chat
3. **Respect privacy** - Don't share faction chat outside
4. **Coordinate roles** - Designate a shot-caller

| Faction Chat | Faction only | Internal coordination |
| Alliance Chat | All allies | Multi-faction coordination |
