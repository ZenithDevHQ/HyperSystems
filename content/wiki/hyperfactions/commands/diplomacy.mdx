# Diplomacy Commands

These commands allow you to manage your faction's relationships with other factions.

## Forming Alliances

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f ally <faction>",
      description: "Send an alliance request to another faction",
      permission: "hyperfactions.relation.ally"
    }
  ]}
/>

**How Alliances Work:**
1. You send alliance request with `/f ally FactionName`
2. Their Leader or Officer runs `/f ally YourFaction`
3. Alliance is now active for both factions

<InfoBox variant="info">
Alliances require mutual agreement. Both factions must `/f ally` each other.
</InfoBox>

**Allied Benefits:**
- No friendly fire between members
- Shared territory access (if configured)
- Alliance chat with `/f a`
- Displayed in green on maps

## Declaring Enemies

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f enemy <faction>",
      description: "Declare another faction as an enemy",
      permission: "hyperfactions.relation.enemy"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Enemy Declaration:**
- Takes effect immediately (one-sided)
- Full PvP enabled against them
- Overclaiming becomes available (if their power is low)
- They appear red on your map

<InfoBox variant="warning">
Enemy declarations are one-sided. The other faction must also `/f enemy` you for mutual war.
</InfoBox>

## Returning to Neutral

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f neutral <faction>",
      description: "Reset relationship to neutral (removes ally or enemy status)",
      permission: "hyperfactions.relation.neutral"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Usage:**
- Break an alliance (takes effect immediately)
- Remove enemy status
- Return to default neutral state

## Viewing Relations

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f relations",
      description: "View all your faction's diplomatic relationships",
      permission: "hyperfactions.relation.view"
    }
  ]}
/>

Shows:
- Current allies
- Current enemies
- Pending alliance requests

They are now your enemy. You can PvP and potentially overclaim them.

### Breaking an Alliance

```

## Strategic Diplomacy

### When to Ally
- **Shared enemy** - United against a common threat
- **Trade partners** - Beneficial resource exchange
- **Protection** - Smaller factions can ally with larger ones
- **Geography** - Neighboring factions benefit from non-aggression

### When to Declare Enemy
- **Territory disputes** - They're blocking your expansion
- **Revenge** - They attacked you or your allies
- **Competition** - Racing for the same resources
- **Preparing to overclaim** - You need enemy status first

### Diplomatic Tips
1. **Don't overextend** - Too many allies means too many wars
2. **Honor agreements** - Reputation matters
3. **Strategic neutrality** - Sometimes it's best to stay out
4. **Check power levels** - Don't enemy a faction you can't defeat
