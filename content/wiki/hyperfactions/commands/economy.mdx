# Economy Commands

These commands allow you to manage your faction's treasury, including deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and transaction history. All economy commands use the `/f money` subcommand.

<InfoBox variant="warning" title="VaultUnlocked Required">
Economy features require the VaultUnlocked economy plugin to be installed and configured on the server. Without it, all `/f money` commands will be disabled. Contact your server administrator if economy commands are unavailable.
</InfoBox>

## Viewing Balance

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f money balance",
      description: "View your faction's treasury balance",
      permission: "hyperfactions.economy.balance"
    },
    {
      command: "/f money balance <faction>",
      description: "View another faction's treasury balance",
      permission: "hyperfactions.economy.balance"
    }
  ]}
/>

The balance display shows:
- Current treasury amount
- Currency name and symbol (configured by server)

<InfoBox variant="tip">
If no faction is specified, the command defaults to your own faction's balance.
</InfoBox>

## Depositing Funds

<CommandBlock

    {
      command: "/f money deposit <amount>",
      description: "Deposit personal funds into your faction's treasury",

    }
  ]}

By default, all faction members (Member rank and above) can deposit funds. This is controlled by the `treasuryDeposit` faction permission.
</InfoBox>

## Withdrawing Funds

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f money withdraw <amount>",
