# Home & Teleport Commands

HyperFactions provides a faction home system that allows members to teleport to a shared location.

## Teleporting Home

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f home",
      description: "Teleport to your faction's home location",
      permission: "hyperfactions.home"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Teleport Process:**
1. Command starts a warmup countdown
2. Player must not move or take damage
3. After warmup completes, teleportation occurs
4. Cooldown begins before next use

<InfoBox variant="info">
Default warmup is 5 seconds. Default cooldown is 5 minutes. Both are configurable.
</InfoBox>

## Setting Faction Home

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f sethome",
      description: "Set the faction home to your current location",
      permission: "hyperfactions.sethome"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Requirements:**
- Must be the Leader
- Standing in faction-claimed territory
- Saves exact position and rotation

<InfoBox variant="tip">
Set your faction home inside a protected building within your claimed territory for safety.
</InfoBox>

## Quick Reference

| Command | Description | Role Required |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `/f home` | Teleport to faction home | Member+ |
| `/f sethome` | Set faction home location | Leader |

## Teleport Configuration

The teleport system is highly configurable:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `teleport.warmupSeconds` | 5 | Seconds before teleport |
| `teleport.cooldownMinutes` | 5 | Minutes between teleports |
| `teleport.cancelOnMove` | true | Cancel if player moves |
| `teleport.cancelOnDamage` | true | Cancel if player takes damage |
| `teleport.crossWorld` | true | Allow cross-dimension teleport |

## Bypass Permissions

Admins can grant bypass permissions:

<PermissionTable
  permissions={[
    {
      permission: "hyperfactions.bypass.warmup",
      description: "Skip the teleport warmup",
      default: "false"
    },
    {
      permission: "hyperfactions.bypass.cooldown",
      description: "Skip the teleport cooldown",
      default: "false"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Examples

### Setting Up Faction Home

1. **Claim the area first:**
   ```
   /f claim
   ```

2. **Stand where you want the home:**
   Position yourself exactly where members should appear.

3. **Set the home:**
   ```
   /f sethome
   ```

4. **Test it:**
   ```
   /f home
   ```

### Using Faction Home

```
/f home
```

Output: "Teleporting to faction home in 5 seconds. Don't move!"

*After 5 seconds, you appear at the faction home.*

## Strategic Home Placement

### Good Locations
- **Inside a secure building** - Protected from enemies
- **Central to your territory** - Easy access to all claims
- **Near important resources** - Farms, storage, etc.
- **Underground or hidden** - Harder for enemies to camp

### Bad Locations
- **Outside your claims** - Cannot set home in unclaimed land
- **Exposed areas** - Enemies can wait for teleports
- **Near territory borders** - Risk of losing the home if overclaimed

## Cross-Dimension Teleportation

When `crossWorld` is enabled:
- Home can be in any dimension
- Members teleport across dimensions
- Useful for bases in different worlds

When `crossWorld` is disabled:
- Home only works in the same dimension
- Error message if in a different world

## Warmup Cancellation

Teleportation is cancelled if:

| Action | Config Key |
|--------|------------|
| Player moves | `cancelOnMove` |
| Player takes damage | `cancelOnDamage` |

<InfoBox variant="warning">
Stay perfectly still and avoid combat during the warmup to ensure successful teleportation.
</InfoBox>

## Home vs Stuck

| Feature | `/f home` | `/f stuck` |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Destination | Faction home | Nearest wilderness |
| Requirement | Faction must have home set | Must be in hostile territory |
| Warmup | Configurable (default 5s) | Fixed (30s) |
| Cooldown | Configurable (default 5m) | None |
