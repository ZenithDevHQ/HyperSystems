# Home & Teleport Commands

HyperFactions provides a faction home system that allows members to teleport to a shared location, plus a stuck command for escaping hostile territory.

## Teleporting Home

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f home",
      description: "Teleport to your faction's home location",
      permission: "hyperfactions.teleport.home"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Teleport Process:**
1. Command starts a warmup countdown
2. Player must not move or take damage
3. After warmup completes, teleportation occurs
4. Cooldown begins before next use

<InfoBox variant="info">
Default warmup is 5 seconds. Default cooldown is 5 minutes. Both are configurable.
</InfoBox>

## Setting Faction Home

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f sethome",
      description: "Set the faction home to your current location",
      permission: "hyperfactions.teleport.sethome"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Requirements:**
- Must be the Leader
- Standing in faction-claimed territory
- Saves exact position and rotation

<InfoBox variant="tip">
Set your faction home inside a protected building within your claimed territory for safety.
</InfoBox>

## Stuck Command

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f stuck",
      description: "Teleport to nearby wilderness when trapped in hostile territory",
      permission: "hyperfactions.teleport.stuck"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Behavior:**
- 30-second warmup by default
- 5-minute cooldown by default
- Cancelled by movement or damage
- Teleports to nearest unclaimed chunk
- Only works in territory you don't own

<InfoBox variant="info" title="When to Use">
Use `/f stuck` when you're trapped in enemy territory with no way to escape. The long warmup prevents combat abuse.
</InfoBox>

### Stuck Configuration

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `stuck.warmupSeconds` | 30 | Warmup before teleport |

## Examples

### Setting Up Faction Home

1. **Claim the area first:**
   ```
   /f claim
   ```

2. **Stand where you want the home:**
   Position yourself exactly where members should appear.

3. **Set the home:**
   ```
   /f sethome
   ```

4. **Test it:**
   ```
   /f home
   ```

### Using Faction Home

```
/f home
```

Output: "Teleporting to faction home in 5 seconds. Don't move!"

*After 5 seconds, you appear at the faction home.*

### Escaping Enemy Territory

```
/f stuck
```

Output: "Teleporting to wilderness in 30 seconds. Don't move or take damage!"

*After 30 seconds, you appear at the nearest unclaimed chunk.*

## Strategic Home Placement

### Good Locations
- **Inside a secure building** - Protected from enemies
- **Central to your territory** - Easy access to all claims
- **Near important resources** - Farms, storage, etc.
- **Underground or hidden** - Harder for enemies to camp

### Bad Locations
- **Outside your claims** - Cannot set home in unclaimed land
- **Exposed areas** - Enemies can wait for teleports
- **Near territory borders** - Risk of losing the home if overclaimed

## Cross-Dimension Teleportation

When `crossWorld` is enabled:
- Home can be in any dimension
- Members teleport across dimensions
- Useful for bases in different worlds

When `crossWorld` is disabled:
- Home only works in the same dimension
- Error message if in a different world

## Warmup Cancellation

Teleportation is cancelled if:

| Action | Config Key |
|--------|------------|
| Player moves | `cancelOnMove` |
| Player takes damage | `cancelOnDamage` |

<InfoBox variant="warning">
Stay perfectly still and avoid combat during the warmup to ensure successful teleportation.
</InfoBox>

## Home vs Stuck Comparison

| Feature | `/f home` | `/f stuck` |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Destination | Faction home | Nearest wilderness |
| Requirement | Faction must have home set | Must be in non-owned territory |
| Warmup | 5 seconds (default) | 30 seconds (default) |
| Cooldown | 5 minutes (default) | 5 minutes (default) |
| Combat use | Can be used anywhere | For escaping only |
| Permission | `hyperfactions.teleport.home` | `hyperfactions.teleport.stuck` |
