# Info & Viewing

These commands let you inspect factions, players, power levels, and activity logs. They are read-only commands that do not modify any faction data.

## Faction Information

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f info",
      description: "View your faction's information card",
      permission: "hyperfactions.info.faction"
    },
    {
      command: "/f info <faction>",
      description: "View another faction's information card",
      permission: "hyperfactions.info.faction"
    }
  ]}
/>

The faction information card displays:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Faction name and tag |
| **Description** | Faction description text |
| **Leader** | Current faction leader |
| **Members** | Total member count (online/offline breakdown) |
| **Power** | Current power / maximum power |
| **Land** | Number of claimed chunks |
| **Claim Capacity** | Maximum claims based on current power |
| **Raidable** | Whether the faction can be overclaimed |
| **Relations** | Allied and enemy factions |

<InfoBox variant="tip">
Use `/f info` without arguments to quickly check your own faction's status. This is especially useful for monitoring your power buffer and raidable status.
</InfoBox>

## Player Information

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f who <player>",
      description: "View a player's faction information",
      permission: "hyperfactions.info.player"
    }
  ]}
/>

Player information shows:
- The player's faction (if any)
- Their role within the faction (Leader, Officer, or Member)
- Their personal power level
- Online/offline status
- Your faction's relation to their faction

<InfoBox variant="info">
If the player is not in a faction, the command will indicate they are factionless.
</InfoBox>

## Power Information

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f power",
      description: "View your personal power information",
      permission: "hyperfactions.info.power"
    }
  ]}
/>

Power information displays:
- Your current personal power
- Your maximum power
- Power regeneration rate
- Your contribution to your faction's total power

For a full explanation of how power works, see [Power System](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/concepts/power-system).

## Member List

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f members",
      description: "View your faction's member list",
      permission: "hyperfactions.info.members"
    }
  ]}
/>

The member list shows:
- All faction members grouped by role (Leader, Officers, Members)
- Online/offline status for each member
- Individual power levels
- Last seen timestamp for offline members

<InfoBox variant="tip">
The member list is useful for identifying inactive members who may be draining your faction's claim capacity without contributing active power regeneration.
</InfoBox>

## Faction List

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f list",
      description: "List all factions on the server",
      permission: "hyperfactions.info.list"
    }
  ]}
/>

The faction list displays:
- Faction names and tags
- Member counts
- Power levels
- Online member counts
- Your relation to each faction (ally, enemy, neutral)

Factions are sorted by member count by default. The list is paginated for servers with many factions.

## Activity Logs

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f logs",
      description: "View your faction's activity logs",
      permission: "hyperfactions.info.logs"
    }
  ]}
/>

Activity logs record:
- Member joins and leaves
- Territory claims and unclaims
- Diplomatic changes (ally, enemy, neutral)
- Leadership changes (promotions, demotions, transfers)
- Setting changes (name, description, color, tag)
- Invitations sent and accepted

<InfoBox variant="info">
Activity logs are separate from economy transaction logs. Use `/f money log` to view financial transactions. See [Economy Commands](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/commands/economy) for details.
</InfoBox>

## Help

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f help",
      description: "View the help menu with command documentation",
      permission: "hyperfactions.info.help"
    }
  ]}
/>

The help menu includes:
- Complete command reference organized by category
