# Member Management Commands

These commands let you manage your faction's membership - inviting new players, removing members, and managing the role hierarchy.

## Inviting Players

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f invite <player>",
      description: "Send a faction invitation to a player",
      permission: "hyperfactions.member.invite"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Requirements:**
- Player must be online
- Player must not be in a faction
- Faction must not be at member limit
- Officer or Leader role required

<InfoBox variant="info">
Invitations expire after a configurable time (default: 5 minutes). The player must accept before it expires.
</InfoBox>

## Accepting Invitations

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f accept",
      description: "Accept a pending faction invitation",
      permission: "hyperfactions.member.join"
    },
    {
      command: "/f join <faction>",
      description: "Join an open faction",
      permission: "hyperfactions.member.join"
    }
  ]}
/>

**For the invited player:**
- Must have a pending invitation (for accept)
- Target faction must be open (for join)
- Must not already be in a faction
- Joins as Member role

## Requesting to Join (Closed Factions)

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f request <faction>",
      description: "Send a join request to a closed faction",
      permission: "hyperfactions.member.request"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Requirements:**
- Must not already be in a faction
- Target faction must be closed (open factions use `/f join` instead)
- Only one pending request at a time

**How it works:**
1. Player sends a join request to a closed faction
2. Officers and Leaders of the target faction are notified
3. An Officer or Leader can accept or deny the request
4. If accepted, the player joins as a Member

<InfoBox variant="info">
Join requests expire after a configurable time. If no Officer or Leader responds, the request is automatically removed.
</InfoBox>

## Kicking Members

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f kick <player>",
      description: "Remove a player from your faction",
      permission: "hyperfactions.member.kick"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Kick Hierarchy:**
| Your Role | Can Kick |
|-----------|----------|
| Leader | Anyone (Officers and Members) |
| Officer | Members only |
| Member | No one |

<InfoBox variant="warning">
You cannot kick someone of equal or higher rank. Officers cannot kick other Officers.
</InfoBox>

## Promoting Members

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f promote <player>",
      description: "Promote a Member to Officer",
      permission: "hyperfactions.member.promote"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Requirements:**
- Must be the Leader
- Target must be a Member
- Target becomes an Officer

<InfoBox variant="tip">
Only promote players you trust. Officers have significant power including diplomacy and kicking.
</InfoBox>

## Demoting Officers

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f demote <player>",
      description: "Demote an Officer to Member",
      permission: "hyperfactions.member.demote"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Requirements:**
- Must be the Leader
- Target must be an Officer
- Target becomes a Member

## Transferring Leadership

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f transfer <player>",
      description: "Transfer faction leadership to another member",
      permission: "hyperfactions.member.transfer"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Transfer Process:**
1. Target becomes the new Leader
2. You become an Officer
3. Takes effect immediately

<InfoBox variant="danger" title="Irreversible">
Leadership transfer cannot be undone by you. The new Leader must transfer back if desired.
</InfoBox>

## Workflow Examples

### New Faction Setup

1. Create faction: `/f create MyFaction`
2. Invite friends: `/f invite Friend1`, `/f invite Friend2`
3. They accept: `/f accept`
4. Promote trusted players: `/f promote Friend1`

### Dealing with Inactivity

1. Check who's inactive via `/f info`
2. Kick inactive members: `/f kick InactivePlayer`
3. Invite active replacements: `/f invite ActivePlayer`

### Leadership Succession

1. Choose a trusted Officer (or promote someone first)
2. Transfer: `/f transfer NewLeader`
3. You remain as Officer under the new leadership

## Best Practices

### For Leaders
- **Vet new members** - Check their history before promoting
- **Communicate promotions** - Let the faction know about role changes
- **Plan succession** - Have a backup plan for leadership

### For Officers
- **Coordinate kicks** - Discuss with Leader before kicking
- **Responsible inviting** - Only invite players who fit the faction

### For Everyone
- **Be active** - Inactive members may be kicked
- **Follow rules** - Respect the faction's guidelines
- **Communicate** - Use faction chat to stay in touch
