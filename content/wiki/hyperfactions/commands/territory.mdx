# Territory Commands

These commands let you claim land, manage your territory, and view the world map.

## Claiming Land

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f claim",
      description: "Claim the chunk you're standing in for your faction",
      permission: "hyperfactions.territory.claim"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Requirements:**
- Must have sufficient faction power
- Chunk must be unclaimed
- If adjacent mode is enabled, chunk must connect to existing claims
- Cannot claim SafeZones or WarZones

<InfoBox variant="info">
Each claim requires power to maintain. Make sure your faction has enough power before claiming.
</InfoBox>

## Unclaiming Land

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f unclaim",
      description: "Release the chunk you're standing in",
      permission: "hyperfactions.territory.unclaim"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Requirements:**
- Must be in a chunk your faction owns
- Officer or Leader role required
- If adjacent mode is enabled, unclaim must not fragment territory

<InfoBox variant="warning">
Unclaiming removes protection from that chunk. Make sure you've moved any valuables first.
</InfoBox>

## Viewing the Map

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f map",
      description: "Open the chunk management GUI with territory map",
      permission: "hyperfactions.territory.map"
    }
  ]}
/>

The map displays a 15x15 chunk grid showing:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Your faction color | Your claims |
| Green | Allied claims |
| Red | Enemy claims |
| Yellow | Neutral faction claims |
| Bright Green (S) | SafeZone |
| Bright Red (W) | WarZone |
| Gray | Wilderness (unclaimed) |

## Overclaiming

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f overclaim",
      description: "Capture an enemy faction's chunk when their power is too low",
      permission: "hyperfactions.territory.overclaim"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Requirements:**
1. Target chunk must be claimed by another faction
2. Target faction must have **insufficient power** for their claims (raidable)
3. Your faction must have the power capacity to claim

<InfoBox variant="tip" title="When Can You Overclaim?">
Enemy faction power must be less than: (Their Claims x Power Per Claim)

Example: If an enemy has 30 claims and power per claim is 2, you can overclaim when their power drops below 60.
</InfoBox>

## Stuck/Escape

<CommandBlock
  commands={[
    {
      command: "/f stuck",
      description: "Teleport to nearby wilderness when trapped in enemy territory",
      permission: "hyperfactions.teleport.stuck"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Behavior:**
- 30-second warmup by default
- Cancelled by movement or damage
- Teleports to nearest unclaimed chunk
- Only works in hostile territory
- 5-minute cooldown

<InfoBox variant="info">
Use this command if you're trapped in enemy territory with no way out.
</InfoBox>

## Examples

### Claiming Your First Chunk

Stand in an unclaimed chunk near your base and run this to claim it.

### Expanding Territory

/f claim

Continue claiming adjacent chunks to expand your territory.

### Checking the Map Before Claiming

## Strategic Tips

### Claiming Strategy
1. **Start with a core** - Claim chunks around your main base first
2. **Expand outward** - Add adjacent chunks to maintain connectivity
3. **Buffer zones** - Claim wilderness around valuable areas
4. **Power management** - Don't claim more than you can defend

### Defense Strategy
1. **Monitor power** - Keep faction power above claim requirements
2. **Strategic unclaiming** - Release non-essential claims if power drops
3. **Active members** - More active members = more power

### Overclaim Strategy
1. **Weaken first** - Kill enemies to reduce their power
2. **Time attacks** - Strike when few enemies are online
3. **Priority targets** - Overclaim important chunks first (homes, farms)
