# Diplomacy

The diplomacy system allows factions to form alliances, declare enemies, or maintain neutral relations with other factions.

## Relationship Types

### Neutral (Default)
All factions start as neutral to each other.

**Neutral Relations:**
- PvP enabled with penalties
- No shared land access
- Standard combat rules apply

### Allied
Allies are factions that have mutual trust and cooperation.

**Allied Benefits:**
- No friendly fire between members
- Shared land access (if configured)
- Alliance chat communication (`/f a`)
- Displayed in green on maps and lists

### Enemy
Enemies are hostile factions marked for conflict.

**Enemy Effects:**
- Full PvP enabled without penalties
- Overclaiming available
- Displayed in red on maps and lists
- Combat encouraged

## Forming Alliances

Alliance creation requires **mutual agreement** from both factions.

### Step 1: Send Alliance Request
```
/f ally FactionName
```

### Step 2: Other Faction Accepts
The other faction's leader must also run:
```
/f ally YourFaction
```

<InfoBox variant="info">
Both factions must `/f ally` each other. One-sided requests don't create alliances.
</InfoBox>

### Breaking an Alliance
To end an alliance:
```
/f neutral FactionName
```

The alliance ends immediately without requiring the other faction's agreement.

## Declaring Enemies

Unlike alliances, enemy declarations are **one-sided**.

### Declaring an Enemy
```
/f enemy FactionName
```

This marks them as your enemy, enabling:
- Full PvP against their members
- Overclaiming their territory (if their power is low)

<InfoBox variant="warning">
Declaring someone your enemy doesn't make them your enemy by default. They must also declare you an enemy for the full effect.
</InfoBox>

### One-Sided vs Mutual Enemies
| Scenario | Your View | Their View | PvP Rules |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| You enemy them only | Enemy (red) | Neutral | Normal PvP |
| They enemy you only | Neutral | Enemy (red) | Normal PvP |
| Mutual enemies | Enemy (red) | Enemy (red) | Full warfare |

## Returning to Neutral

To remove enemy or ally status:

```
/f neutral FactionName
```

This resets the relationship to the default neutral state.

## Viewing Relations

### Your Faction's Relations
```
/f relations
```

Shows all your allies and enemies.

### Specific Faction Info
```
/f info FactionName
```

Shows their relations section.

## Strategic Considerations

### Alliance Benefits
- **Strength in numbers** - Combined forces against enemies
- **Shared territory access** - Coordinate defense
- **Communication** - Alliance chat for coordination
- **No accidents** - Friendly fire prevention

### Alliance Risks
- **Dragged into wars** - Their enemies become your concern
- **Resource sharing** - May need to help defend their land
- **Trust issues** - Betrayal is always possible

### Enemy Tactics
- **Weaken first** - Reduce their power through combat
- **Coordinate attacks** - Ally with their enemies
- **Overclaim** - Take their land when power drops
- **Cut off resources** - Claim strategic areas
