# Factions

Factions are the core organizational unit in HyperFactions. A faction is a group of players who share land, resources, and work together toward common goals.

## Creating a Faction

To create a faction, use:

```
/f create <name>
```

<InfoBox variant="info" title="Naming Rules">
- **Length:** 3-24 characters
- **Characters:** Letters, numbers, and underscores only
- **Pattern:** Configured via `allowedNamePattern` in config
</InfoBox>

When you create a faction, you automatically become its **Leader** with full administrative powers.

## Faction Properties

### Name
The unique identifier for your faction, displayed in chat, on maps, and in the faction list.

### Description
A short text describing your faction, visible when others view your faction info:

```
/f desc Our faction rules!
```

### Color
A hex color code that represents your faction on maps and in GUI elements:

```
/f color #FF5500
```

### Open/Closed Status
- **Open:** Anyone can join without an invitation
- **Closed:** Players must be invited to join (default)

```
/f open   # Allow anyone to join
/f close  # Require invitations
```

## Member Limits

Each faction has a configurable maximum member count:

| Config Option | Default | Description |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| `faction.maxMembers` | 50 | Maximum players per faction |

<InfoBox variant="tip">
Consider your server's player base when setting member limits. Smaller limits encourage more factions and more conflict.
</InfoBox>

## Faction Power

A faction's power is the sum of all its members' personal power:

```
Faction Power = Sum of all member power
```

This determines:
- How much land the faction can claim
- Whether the faction can be overclaimed
- Overall faction strength

See [Power System](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/concepts/power-system) for details.

## Viewing Faction Information

### Your Faction
```
/f info
```

### Another Faction
```
/f info FactionName
```

This displays:
- Faction name and description
- Leader and member count
- Total power and claim count
- Diplomatic relations
- Online members

## Listing Factions

View all factions on the server:

```
/f list
```

The list shows faction names, member counts, and power levels.

## Leaving a Faction

To leave your current faction:

```
/f leave
```

<InfoBox variant="warning">
If you're the Leader, you must either transfer leadership or disband the faction before leaving.
</InfoBox>

## Disbanding a Faction

As Leader, you can dissolve your faction:

```
/f disband
```

<InfoBox variant="danger" title="This is Permanent">
Disbanding removes all claims, resets all members, and cannot be undone. A confirmation prompt prevents accidents.
</InfoBox>

## Faction Storage

Each faction's data is stored in a separate JSON file:

```
plugins/HyperFactions/data/factions/{uuid}.json
```

This isolation ensures:
- Fast access to faction data
- Easy backup of individual factions
- No data corruption between factions
