# Factions

Factions are the core organizational unit in HyperFactions. A faction is a group of players who share territory, work together toward common goals, and interact with other factions through diplomacy or conflict.

## What is a Faction?

A faction consists of:

- **Members** - Players who belong to the faction, organized into roles
- **Territory** - Chunks of land claimed and protected by the faction
- **Power** - A resource derived from member activity that determines claim capacity
- **Relations** - Diplomatic status with other factions (ally, neutral, enemy)

When you create a faction, you become its **Leader** with full administrative control.

## Faction Identity

Each faction has properties that define its identity:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Unique identifier (3-24 characters, alphanumeric + underscores) |
| **Tag** | Short abbreviation shown in chat |
| **Description** | Text visible when viewing faction info |
| **Color** | Hex color for maps and GUI elements |

For command details, see [Basic Commands](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/commands/basic) and [Settings Commands](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/commands/settings).

## Membership

Factions can be **open** or **closed**:

- **Open factions** allow anyone to join freely
- **Closed factions** (default) require an invitation

Each faction has a maximum member count controlled by server configuration. The default is 50 members per faction.

## Faction Roles

Members are organized into three roles with different capabilities:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Leader** | Full control - can disband, transfer leadership, manage all settings |
| **Officer** | Management - can invite, kick members, claim territory, manage relations |
| **Member** | Basic access - can use faction home, chat, and build in territory |

For detailed role information, see [Roles](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/concepts/roles).

## Faction Power

A faction's total power equals the sum of all its members' individual power. This determines:

- How many chunks the faction can claim
- Whether the faction is vulnerable to overclaiming
- Overall faction strength

For detailed power mechanics, see [Power System](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/concepts/power-system).

## Territory Protection

Factions protect their claimed territory through configurable permission flags. Leaders can control what actions are allowed within their territory through the faction settings GUI.

**Available flag categories:**

| Category | Flags | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Combat | 4 flags | PvP, friendly fire, projectiles, mob damage |
| Building | 2 flags | Block placement/breaking, general interaction |
| Interaction | 5 flags | Doors, containers, crafting, processing, seats |
| Items | 2 flags | Item drop and pickup |
| Damage | 2 flags | Fall damage, environmental damage |

Server administrators can lock certain flags to enforce server-wide rules. See the [Configuration Reference](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/reference/configuration) for details.

## Faction Lifecycle

### Creation
Any player with the appropriate permission can create a faction. The creator becomes the Leader.

### Growth
Factions grow by inviting members and claiming territory. More members means more power and larger potential territory.

### Dissolution
A faction can be disbanded by its Leader, which removes all claims and releases all members. This action requires confirmation and cannot be undone.

## Data Storage

Each faction's data is stored in a separate JSON file:

```
mods/com.hyperfactions_HyperFactions/factions/{uuid}.json
```

This isolation ensures fast access and prevents data corruption between factions.
