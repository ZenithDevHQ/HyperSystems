# Power System

The power system is the backbone of HyperFactions' territory and warfare mechanics. Every player contributes power to their faction, which determines how much territory the faction can hold and whether enemies can raid you.

## How Power Works

### Personal Power

Each player has their own personal power that contributes to their faction:

| Property | Default Value | Config Key |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Starting Power | 10.0 | `power.startingPower` |
| Maximum Power | 20.0 | `power.maxPlayerPower` |

When you first join the server or create a faction, you start with **10 power** and can regenerate up to a maximum of **20 power**.

### Faction Power

A faction's total power is the sum of all member power:

```
Total Faction Power = Sum of all online member power + Sum of all offline member power
```

<InfoBox variant="info" title="Example Calculation">
A faction with 5 members:
- Player A: 20 power (max)
- Player B: 15 power
- Player C: 18 power
- Player D: 12 power (just died)
- Player E: 10 power (just joined)

**Total Faction Power: 75**
</InfoBox>

## Power and Territory Claims

Each chunk of territory your faction claims requires power to maintain:

| Property | Default Value | Config Key |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Power per Claim | 2.0 | `power.powerPerClaim` |
| Hard Claim Limit | 100 | `claims.maxClaims` |

### Maximum Claims Formula

Your faction's maximum allowed claims is calculated as:

```
Max Claims = min(floor(Total Faction Power / Power Per Claim), Hard Claim Limit)
```

<InfoBox variant="tip" title="Example: Calculating Max Claims">
**Given:**
- Total Faction Power: 75
- Power Per Claim: 2.0
- Hard Claim Limit: 100

**Calculation:**
- Power-based claims: floor(75 / 2) = **37 claims**
- Limited by hard cap: min(37, 100) = **37 claims**

Your faction can hold up to **37 chunks** of territory.
</InfoBox>

### Claim Capacity vs. Actual Claims

Understanding the relationship between your power and claims is critical:

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Claims < Max Claims | Safe - you have a power buffer |
| Claims = Max Claims | At capacity - no buffer for deaths |
| Claims > Max Claims | **Vulnerable to overclaiming** |

## Power Regeneration

Power regenerates automatically over time for online players:

| Property | Default Value | Config Key |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Regen Rate | 0.1 per minute | `power.regenPerMinute` |
| Offline Regen | Disabled | `power.regenWhenOffline` |

### Regeneration Calculations

With the default rate of **0.1 power per minute**:

| Time Period | Power Regenerated |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 minute | 0.1 power |
| 10 minutes | 1.0 power |
| 1 hour | 6.0 power |
| Full recovery (0→20) | ~3.3 hours |

<InfoBox variant="info" title="Online-Only Regeneration">
By default, power only regenerates while you're online. Server owners can enable offline regeneration with `power.regenWhenOffline: true`, but this is disabled by default to encourage active participation.
</InfoBox>

## Power Loss

### Death Penalty

When a player dies, they lose power:

| Property | Default Value | Config Key |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Death Penalty | 1.0 | `power.deathPenalty` |
| Kill Reward | 0.0 | `power.killReward` |

The **kill reward** grants power to a player when they kill another player. By default this is set to 0.0 (disabled), but server owners can enable it to reward PvP combat. For example, setting `killReward` to 0.5 means a player gains 0.5 power for each player kill.

<InfoBox variant="warning" title="Combat Implications">
If you die multiple times in quick succession, your power can drop significantly. At 0.1 regen per minute, recovering 1 power lost from death takes **10 minutes**.
</InfoBox>

### Combat Tag Logout Penalty

If you disconnect while combat tagged:

| Property | Default Value | Config Key |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Logout Penalty Enabled | Yes | `combat.taggedLogoutPenalty` |
| Logout Power Loss | 1.0 | `combat.logoutPowerLoss` |

<InfoBox variant="danger" title="Don't Combat Log!">
Disconnecting during combat results in additional power loss. Stay and fight or escape properly before logging out.
</InfoBox>

### Minimum Power

Power cannot drop below **0**. Even after multiple deaths, your personal power will remain at 0 until you regenerate.

## Overclaiming

When a faction's total power drops below what's needed to maintain their claims, they become **raidable** - enemies can overclaim their territory.

### Overclaim Conditions

For an enemy to overclaim your territory:

1. Your faction must have **negative power balance** (current claims × power per claim > total power)
2. The enemy must use `/f overclaim` in your territory

### Preventing Raids

To avoid being overclaimed:

1. **Maintain a power buffer** - Keep faction power well above your claim requirements
2. **Minimize deaths** - Each death reduces total faction power
3. **Don't overexpand** - Only claim what you can defend
4. **Stay active** - Online members regenerate power

<InfoBox variant="tip" title="Power Buffer Strategy">
**Recommended buffer:** Maintain at least 20% more power than your claim requirements.

Example: If you have 30 claims requiring 60 power, aim for **72+ total faction power** to have a safe buffer.
</InfoBox>

## Power Limits via Permissions

Server owners can grant custom power limits using permissions:

```
hyperfactions.limit.power.<amount>
```

| Permission | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| `hyperfactions.limit.power.30` | Player max power is 30 |
| `hyperfactions.limit.power.50` | Player max power is 50 |
| `hyperfactions.limit.power.100` | Player max power is 100 |

<InfoBox variant="info" title="For Server Owners">
Use permission-based power limits to create VIP tiers or reward active players:
```
/hp group setperm vip hyperfactions.limit.power.50
```
This allows VIP players to accumulate up to 50 power instead of the default 20.
</InfoBox>

## Viewing Power Information

Power information is available through various faction commands:

- **Faction info** displays total faction power, current claims, power required for claims, and raidable status
- **Personal power** shows your individual power and maximum
- **Other factions** can be inspected to assess their vulnerability

See [Basic Commands](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/commands/basic) for the info and power command syntax.

## Strategic Considerations

### For New Factions

1. **Start small** - Claim only essential territory initially
2. **Build power first** - Wait for members to regenerate before expanding
3. **Recruit carefully** - New members start at 10 power, but also add claim capacity

### For Established Factions

1. **Monitor power balance** - Check `/f info` regularly
2. **Before wars** - Ensure high power buffer
3. **After losses** - Don't claim more until power recovers

### During Warfare

**Offensive Strategy:**
1. Kill enemy faction members repeatedly
2. Wait for their power to drop
3. Overclaim their territory when vulnerable

**Defensive Strategy:**
1. Minimize deaths at all costs
2. Stay online to regenerate faster
3. Temporarily unclaim non-essential territory if needed

## Configuration Examples

### High-Intensity PvP Server

```json
{
  "power": {
    "maxPlayerPower": 10,
    "startingPower": 5,
    "deathPenalty": 2,
    "regenPerMinute": 0.2,
    "powerPerClaim": 1
  }
}
```

- Lower max power = smaller empires
- Higher death penalty = wars matter more
- Faster regen = quicker recovery
- Lower power per claim = more territory per power

### Casual/Building-Focused Server

```json
{
  "power": {
    "maxPlayerPower": 50,
    "startingPower": 25,
    "deathPenalty": 0,
    "regenPerMinute": 0.05,
    "powerPerClaim": 5
  }
}
```

- Higher max power = larger empires
- No death penalty = peaceful play
- Slower regen (doesn't matter without deaths)
- Higher power per claim = more strategic claiming
