# Power System

The power system is the backbone of HyperFactions' territory and warfare mechanics. Understanding power is essential for successful faction management.

## How Power Works

### Personal Power
Each player has their own personal power:

| Property | Default | Config Key |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Maximum Power | 20 | `power.maxPlayerPower` |
| Starting Power | 10 | `power.startingPower` |

### Faction Power
A faction's total power is calculated as:

```
Faction Power = Sum of all member power
```

<InfoBox variant="info" title="Example">
A faction with 5 members, each at 15 power = **75 total faction power**
</InfoBox>

## Power and Claims

Each chunk claim requires power to maintain:

| Property | Default | Config Key |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Power per Claim | 2 | `power.powerPerClaim` |

**Maximum Claims Formula:**
```
Max Claims = Faction Power / Power Per Claim
```

<InfoBox variant="tip" title="Example">
- Faction power: 60
- Power per claim: 2
- Maximum claims: **30 chunks**
</InfoBox>

If your faction power drops below what's needed to maintain claims, you become vulnerable to **overclaiming**.

## Power Regeneration

Power regenerates automatically over time:

| Property | Default | Config Key |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Regeneration Rate | ~1 per hour | `power.regenPerMinute` |

The default `regenPerMinute` of 0.0167 results in approximately 1 power per hour.

<InfoBox variant="info">
Power regeneration happens per player, not per faction. Each online player regenerates independently.
</InfoBox>

## Power Loss

### Death Penalty
When a player dies, they lose power:

| Property | Default | Config Key |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Death Penalty | 1 | `power.deathPenalty` |

### Neutral Kill Penalty
Killing neutral players may also cost power:

| Property | Default | Config Key |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Neutral Kill Penalty | 1 | `power.neutralKillPenalty` |

### WarZone Deaths
By default, deaths in WarZones don't cause power loss:

| Property | Default | Config Key |
|----------|---------|------------|
| WarZone Power Loss | false | `power.warzonePowerLoss` |

## Power Limits via Permissions

Server administrators can grant per-player or per-group power limits using permissions:

```
hyperfactions.limit.power.<n>
```

Example: `hyperfactions.limit.power.50` allows a player to have up to 50 power.

<InfoBox variant="tip" title="VIP Power">
Grant VIP players higher power limits: `/hp group setperm vip hyperfactions.limit.power.50`
</InfoBox>

## Power and Overclaiming

When a faction's power drops below their claim requirements, enemies can **overclaim** their territory.

**Overclaim Requirements:**
1. Target faction must have insufficient power
2. You must be enemies (if `overclaim.requireEnemyRelation` is true)
3. Target must be at or below `overclaim.powerThreshold`

```
/f overclaim
```

This transfers the current chunk to your faction.

## Strategic Considerations

### Growing Your Faction
More members = more power = more potential claims

But remember:
- Each member needs to maintain their power
- Deaths during wars reduce total power
- Inactive members may log out with low power

### War Strategy
To weaken an enemy faction:
1. Kill their members to reduce power
2. Wait for power to drop below claim requirements
3. Overclaim their territory

To defend:
1. Keep member power high
2. Minimize deaths
3. Maintain power buffer above claim requirements

### Power Buffer
A smart faction maintains extra power beyond their claim needs:

```
Recommended: Faction Power > (Claims × Power Per Claim) + Buffer
```

This buffer protects against temporary power loss from deaths.

## Viewing Power

### Your Power
```
/f info
```
Shows your faction's total power and claim count.

### Checking Vulnerability
If your faction info shows:
- Power: 50
- Claims: 30
- Power per Claim: 2
- Required Power: 60

Your faction is **vulnerable** to overclaiming (50 < 60).

## Configuration Tips

### High Competition (PvP Focused)
```json
{
  "power": {
    "maxPlayerPower": 10,
    "deathPenalty": 2,
    "regenPerMinute": 0.033
  }
}
```
- Lower max power means smaller empires
- Higher death penalty makes wars impactful
- Faster regeneration allows recovery

### Low Competition (Casual)
```json
{
  "power": {
    "maxPlayerPower": 50,
    "deathPenalty": 0,
    "regenPerMinute": 0.0083
  }
}
```
- Higher max power for larger empires
- No death penalty for peaceful play
- Slower regeneration since it's less critical
