# Roles

HyperFactions uses a three-tier role hierarchy to manage faction permissions: Leader, Officer, and Member. Each role has specific capabilities that determine what actions a player can perform within their faction.

## Role Hierarchy

```
        Leader (1)
           │
      Officer (Many)
           │
       Member (Many)
```

Higher roles inherit all permissions from lower roles, plus additional privileges specific to their level.

## Leader

The **Leader** is the founder or current owner of the faction. Each faction has exactly one Leader at any time.

### Leader Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Set faction home | Define the teleport destination for faction members |
| Promote members | Elevate Members to Officer rank |
| Demote officers | Reduce Officers back to Member rank |
| Transfer leadership | Pass leadership to another faction member |
| Disband faction | Permanently dissolve the faction |
| Manage all relations | Set ally, enemy, or neutral status with any faction |
| Kick any member | Remove any player from the faction |
| Rename faction | Change the faction's name |
| Toggle open/closed | Control whether the faction accepts open applications |
| All Officer capabilities | Everything Officers can do |
| All Member capabilities | Everything Members can do |

### Becoming Leader

There are two ways to become a faction Leader:

1. **Create a new faction** - The creator automatically becomes the Leader
2. **Receive leadership transfer** - The current Leader transfers ownership to you

<InfoBox variant="warning">
Leadership transfer is immediate and irreversible. The former Leader is demoted to Officer rank.
</InfoBox>

## Officer

**Officers** are trusted faction members with management capabilities. A faction can have multiple Officers, and they serve as the primary administrators under the Leader.

### Officer Capabilities

|------------|-------------|
| Invite players | Send faction membership invitations |
| Kick Members | Remove Members (but not other Officers) |

| Set description | Update the faction's description text |
| Set color | Change the faction's display color |
| Set tag | Change the faction's chat tag |
| All Member capabilities | Everything Members can do |

### Becoming an Officer

The Leader promotes a Member to Officer. Only the Leader has this authority.

### Losing Officer Status

The Leader can demote an Officer back to Member at any time.

## Member

**Members** are standard faction participants with basic permissions. This is the default role when joining a faction.

### Member Capabilities

| Use faction home | Teleport to the faction home location |
| View faction info | Access faction information |
| Participate in chat | Use faction and alliance chat channels |

There are two ways to become a faction Member:

1. **Accept an invitation** - Receive and accept an invite from an Officer or Leader
2. **Join an open faction** - If the faction has open recruitment enabled

\** Officers can only kick Members, not other Officers

## Role Management

Role changes are managed through member management commands. See [Member Management Commands](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/commands/member-management) for the specific commands to promote, demote, and transfer leadership.

<InfoBox variant="info" title="Permission Hierarchy">
A role can only manage roles strictly below it. Officers cannot kick or manage other Officers - only the Leader can do that.
</InfoBox>

## Best Practices

### For Leaders

- **Promote carefully** - Officers have significant power over the faction
- **Don't over-promote** - Too many Officers can lead to coordination issues
- **Plan succession** - Have a trusted Officer ready in case you become inactive
- **Use transfers wisely** - Leadership transfer cannot be undone

### For Officers

- **Coordinate with the Leader** - Major decisions should be discussed first
- **Manage responsibly** - Kicking and diplomacy changes affect everyone
- **Train new Members** - Help them understand the faction's goals and rules

### For Members

- **Earn trust** - Consistent activity and contribution leads to promotion
- **Follow rules** - Respect faction guidelines set by leadership
- **Communicate** - Use faction chat to stay connected with your team
