# Roles

HyperFactions uses a three-tier role hierarchy to manage faction permissions: Leader, Officer, and Member.

## Role Hierarchy

```
        Leader (1)
           │
      Officer (Many)
           │
       Member (Many)
```

Higher roles can perform all actions of lower roles, plus additional privileges.

## Leader

The **Leader** is the founder or current owner of the faction. Each faction has exactly one Leader.

### Leader Permissions

| Disband faction | Dissolve the faction entirely |
| Manage all relations | Ally, enemy, or neutralize any faction |
| Kick any member | Remove anyone from the faction |

| All Member abilities | Everything Members can do |

### Becoming Leader

1. **Create a faction** - The creator becomes Leader
2. **Receive transfer** - Current Leader transfers to you

## Best Practices

### For Leaders
- **Promote trusted players** - Officers have significant power
- **Don't over-promote** - Too many Officers can create chaos
- **Plan succession** - Have a backup in case you leave

### For Officers
- **Coordinate with Leader** - Major decisions should be discussed
- **Manage responsibly** - Kicking and diplomacy affect everyone
- **Train new Members** - Help them understand the faction

### For Members
- **Earn trust** - Consistent activity leads to promotion
- **Follow rules** - Respect faction guidelines
- **Communicate** - Use faction chat to stay connected
