# Territories

The territory system allows factions to claim chunks of land, protect them from other players, and expand their influence.

## Chunk-Based Claims

Territory is managed in **chunks** - 16x16 block areas that extend from bedrock to sky limit.

<InfoBox variant="tip">
Press F3+G (in most clients) to see chunk boundaries visualized in-game.
</InfoBox>

## Claiming Land

### Basic Claiming
Stand in the chunk you want to claim:

```
/f claim
```

**Requirements:**
- Must have enough faction power
- Chunk must be unclaimed (or enemy with low power for overclaim)
- Adjacent mode may require connection to existing claims

### Adjacent Claims Mode
When enabled (`claims.onlyAdjacent: true`), new claims must connect to existing faction territory.

<InfoBox variant="info">
Adjacent mode prevents "island" claims and creates more cohesive faction territories.
</InfoBox>

### Claiming Costs
Each claim requires power to maintain:

```
Required Power = Number of Claims × Power Per Claim
```

| Config Option | Default |
|---------------|---------|
| `power.powerPerClaim` | 2 |
| `claims.maxClaims` | 100 |

## Unclaiming Land

To release a chunk:

```
/f unclaim
```

**Anti-Fragmentation:**
If adjacent mode is enabled, unclaiming may be blocked if it would split your territory into disconnected pieces.

## The Chunk Map

View your territory and surroundings:

```
/f map
```

The map displays a 15×15 chunk grid showing:
- **Your faction's claims** - In your faction color
- **Enemy claims** - In red
- **Allied claims** - In green
- **Neutral claims** - In yellow
- **SafeZones** - In bright green
- **WarZones** - In bright red
- **Wilderness** - Unclaimed areas

## Territory Protection

Claimed land is protected from outsiders:

### Block Protection
- Block placement blocked
- Block breaking blocked
- Fluid placement blocked

### Container Protection
- Chests locked
- Furnaces locked
- Other storage locked

### Mechanism Protection
- Doors and gates
- Levers and buttons
- Redstone components

### Item Protection
- Item pickup in claimed areas (configurable)

<InfoBox variant="info" title="Allied Access">
When configured, allied faction members can interact with your territory. Control this in your faction settings.
</InfoBox>

## Overclaiming

When an enemy faction's power drops too low, you can take their land:

```
/f overclaim
```

**Requirements:**
1. Target chunk must be claimed by another faction
2. Target faction must have insufficient power for their claims
3. Must be enemies (if `overclaim.requireEnemyRelation` is true)
4. Target power must be at or below threshold

| Config Option | Default |
|---------------|---------|
| `overclaim.enabled` | true |
| `overclaim.requireEnemyRelation` | true |
| `overclaim.powerThreshold` | 0 |

## Claim Decay

Inactive factions can lose claims over time:

| Config Option | Default |
|---------------|---------|
| `claims.decayEnabled` | true |
| `claims.decayDelayMinutes` | 10 |
| `claims.inactiveDecayDays` | 7 |

**Decay Process:**
1. Faction becomes inactive (no members online)
2. After `inactiveDecayDays`, claims begin to decay
3. Claims are released one by one

## Multi-World Support

HyperFactions supports claims across multiple worlds/dimensions:

- Claims are tracked per-dimension
- Faction power applies globally
- Maps show the current dimension only

## Stuck Command

If trapped in enemy territory:

```
/f stuck
```

This teleports you to nearby wilderness after a warmup period (default: 30 seconds).

<InfoBox variant="warning">
The stuck command has a warmup. Movement or damage cancels it.
</InfoBox>

## Territory Strategy

### Defensive Claims
- Claim in a connected pattern
- Don't spread too thin
- Maintain power buffer

### Offensive Claims
- Weaken enemies through combat
- Monitor enemy power levels
- Strike when they're vulnerable

### Chokepoint Control
- Claim strategic locations
- Control access to resources
- Create defensive perimeters

## Storage

Claims are stored in a global registry:

```
plugins/HyperFactions/data/claims.json
```

This allows efficient lookup of claim ownership by chunk coordinates.
