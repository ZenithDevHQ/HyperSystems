# Territories

The territory system allows factions to claim chunks of land, protecting them from outsiders and expanding their influence across the world.

## Chunk-Based Claims

Territory is managed in **chunks** - 32x32 block areas that extend vertically through the world. Each chunk can be claimed by one faction at a time.

## How Claiming Works

Factions can claim chunks as their territory. Claiming requires:

- **Faction power** - Each claim costs power to maintain (default: 2 power per claim)
- **Unclaimed land** - The chunk must be wilderness, or belong to a vulnerable enemy faction
- **Connection** (optional) - When adjacent mode is enabled, new claims must connect to existing territory

The number of claims a faction can hold is limited by their total power:

```
Max Claims = Total Faction Power ÷ Power Per Claim
```

For example, a faction with 50 total power can hold up to 25 claims at the default rate.

For claiming commands, see [Territory Commands](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/commands/territory).

## Territory Protection

Claimed land provides protection for faction members. The protection system checks player permissions based on their relationship to the claiming faction.

### Protection Categories

| Category | What's Protected |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Building** | Block placement and breaking |
| **Containers** | Chests, storage, and crafting stations |
| **Interaction** | Doors, gates, switches, and mechanisms |
| **Items** | Item pickup within claimed areas |

### Access Levels

Protection varies based on the player's relationship to the claiming faction:

| Relationship | Default Access |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Member** | Full access |
| **Ally** | Configurable (interaction by default) |
| **Neutral** | No access |
| **Enemy** | No access |

Faction leaders can customize these permissions through the settings GUI. See [Factions](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/concepts/factions) for details on territory permissions.

## Overclaiming

When a faction's power drops below what's needed for their claims, they become vulnerable to **overclaiming**. Enemy factions can seize their territory.

**Vulnerability condition:**
```
Vulnerable when: Current Claims × Power Per Claim > Total Faction Power
```

This creates strategic gameplay around power management. Deaths cause power loss, so sustained combat can weaken a faction enough to lose territory.

<InfoBox variant="info">
Overclaiming only takes one chunk at a time. The attacking faction must also have sufficient power for the new claim.
</InfoBox>

## Claim Decay

Inactive factions gradually lose claims through the decay system:

1. When no faction members log in for an extended period (default: 30 days), the faction becomes "inactive"
2. Inactive factions begin losing claims over time
3. Claims are released back to wilderness

This prevents abandoned factions from permanently occupying territory.

## Multi-World Support

HyperFactions tracks claims across all worlds and dimensions:

- Claims are stored per-world
- Faction power is global (shared across worlds)
- The chunk map displays the current world only

## The Stuck Command

Players trapped in enemy territory can use the stuck command to escape. After a warmup period (default: 30 seconds), they're teleported to nearby wilderness.

The warmup is cancelled by movement or taking damage, preventing abuse during combat.

## Strategic Considerations

### Defensive Territory
- Claim in connected patterns to prevent fragmentation
- Maintain a power buffer above what's needed for claims
- Don't overextend beyond your faction's power capacity

### Offensive Territory
- Target factions with low power-to-claims ratios
- Coordinate attacks to drain enemy power through combat
- Overclaim strategically valuable chunks first

## Data Storage

Claims are stored within each faction's data file and indexed in memory for fast lookups. See [Installation](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/getting-started/installation) for the data directory structure.
