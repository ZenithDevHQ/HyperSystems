# Zones

HyperFactions provides two special zone types for server administration: **SafeZones** and **WarZones**. These are admin-managed areas with special rules.

## SafeZones

SafeZones are completely protected areas where PvP is disabled and no one can build.

### SafeZone Properties
- **No PvP** - All damage between players is prevented
- **No building** - Block placement and breaking disabled
- **No claiming** - Players cannot claim SafeZone chunks
- **Color:** Bright green on maps

### Common Uses
- Spawn areas
- Server hubs
- Trading centers
- Event venues
- Tutorial areas

<InfoBox variant="info">
SafeZones are typically used for server spawn points and communal areas where players should feel safe.
</InfoBox>

## WarZones

WarZones are designated combat areas where PvP is always enabled, typically without power penalties.

### WarZone Properties
- **PvP always enabled** - Combat allowed regardless of relations
- **No power loss** (configurable) - Deaths don't reduce power
- **No claiming** - Players cannot claim WarZone chunks
- **Color:** Bright red on maps

### Common Uses
- Arena areas
- PvP zones
- Event battlegrounds
- Resource competition areas

<InfoBox variant="tip">
WarZones are great for designated PvP areas where players can fight without affecting their faction's territorial power.
</InfoBox>

## Zone Management

Only admins with `hyperfactions.admin` permission can manage zones.

### Creating a SafeZone
Stand in the chunk and run:
```
/f admin safezone add
```

### Removing a SafeZone
```
/f admin safezone remove
```

### Creating a WarZone
Stand in the chunk and run:
```
/f admin warzone add
```

### Removing a WarZone
```
/f admin warzone remove
```

<InfoBox variant="warning">
Zone changes take effect immediately. Players in the area will be subject to new rules instantly.
</InfoBox>

## Zone Configuration

### WarZone Power Loss
Control whether deaths in WarZones cause power loss:

```json
{
  "power": {
    "warzonePowerLoss": false
  }
}
```

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `false` | No power loss in WarZones (default) |
| `true` | Normal power loss applies |

## Zone Priority

Zone rules take precedence over faction claims:

```
SafeZone > WarZone > Faction Claim > Wilderness
```

If a chunk is marked as a SafeZone:
- Previous faction claims are overridden
- SafeZone rules apply regardless of prior ownership

## Visual Indicators

Zones are visible on the faction map:

| Zone Type | Map Color | Indicator |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| SafeZone | Bright Green | S |
| WarZone | Bright Red | W |
| Your Faction | Your Color | F |
| Enemy | Red | E |
| Ally | Green | A |
| Neutral | Yellow | N |
| Wilderness | Gray | . |

## Zone Storage

Zone data is stored separately:

```
plugins/HyperFactions/data/
├── safezones.json    # SafeZone chunk coordinates
└── warzones.json     # WarZone chunk coordinates
```

## Strategic Zone Placement

### Server Spawn
Create a SafeZone around spawn:
1. Navigate to spawn area
2. For each chunk: `/f admin safezone add`
3. Consider a buffer zone around the core

### PvP Arena
Create a WarZone for arenas:
1. Build your arena
2. Mark arena chunks: `/f admin warzone add`
3. Set `warzonePowerLoss: false` for penalty-free combat

### Resource Areas
Consider WarZones for contested resources:
- Encourages conflict over valuable areas
- No power penalties keep it fair
- Creates natural PvP hotspots

## Comparison Table

| Feature | SafeZone | WarZone | Faction Claim |
|---------|:--------:|:-------:|:-------------:|
| PvP | ✗ | ✓ | Varies |
| Building | ✗ | ✗ | Owner only |
| Power loss on death | N/A | Optional | Yes |
| Can be claimed | ✗ | ✗ | N/A |
| Admin only | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
