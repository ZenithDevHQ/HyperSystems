# Zones

HyperFactions provides two special zone types for server administration: **SafeZones** and **WarZones**. These are admin-managed areas with special rules that can span multiple chunks.

## Zone System Overview

Zones are named entities that can contain multiple chunks, providing flexible area management for server administrators.

**Key features:**
- Named zones (e.g., "spawn", "arena", "market")
- Multi-chunk support with radius claiming
- 15 configurable flags per zone
- GUI-based management
- Priority over faction claims

<InfoBox variant="info" title="For Server Admins">
Zone management requires the `hyperfactions.admin.zones` permission. Regular players cannot create or modify zones.
</InfoBox>

## SafeZones

SafeZones are protected areas where PvP is disabled and players are generally safe. Ideal for spawn points, trading areas, and community spaces.

### SafeZone Default Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|:-------:|-------------|
| **Combat Flags** |||
| `pvp_enabled` | false | Players cannot damage other players |
| `friendly_fire` | false | Faction members cannot hurt each other |
| `projectile_damage` | false | Projectiles deal no damage |
| `mob_damage` | false | Mobs cannot damage players |
| **Building Flags** |||
| `build_allowed` | false | Players cannot place or break blocks |
| `block_interact` | true | General block interaction allowed |
| **Interaction Flags** |||
| `door_use` | true | Players can use doors and gates |
| `container_use` | false | Players cannot access chests or storage |
| `bench_use` | false | Players cannot use crafting tables |
| `processing_use` | false | Players cannot use furnaces or smelters |
| `seat_use` | true | Players can sit on seats and mounts |
| **Item Flags** |||

| `item_pickup` | true | Players can pick up items |
| **Damage Flags** |||
| `fall_damage` | false | No fall damage |
| `environmental_damage` | false | No drowning or suffocation |

### Common SafeZone Uses

- Server spawn areas
- Server hubs and lobbies
- Trading centers and markets
- Event venues
- Tutorial areas
- NPC villages

<InfoBox variant="tip" title="SafeZone Design Tip">
SafeZones disable item dropping by default to prevent players from littering spawn areas with unwanted items.
</InfoBox>

## WarZones

WarZones are designated combat areas where PvP is always enabled but building is blocked to prevent griefing.

### WarZone Default Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|:-------:|-------------|
| **Combat Flags** |||
| `pvp_enabled` | true | PvP combat is enabled |
| `friendly_fire` | false | Faction members still protected |
| `projectile_damage` | true | Projectiles deal damage |
| `mob_damage` | true | Mobs can damage players |
| **Building Flags** |||
| `build_allowed` | false | No block placement/breaking (anti-grief) |
| `block_interact` | true | General block interaction allowed |
| **Interaction Flags** |||
| `door_use` | true | Players can use doors and gates |
| `container_use` | false | No container access |
| `bench_use` | false | No crafting table access |
| `processing_use` | false | No furnace/smelter access |
| `seat_use` | true | Players can sit on seats and mounts |
| **Item Flags** |||
| `item_drop` | true | Players can drop items |
| `item_pickup` | true | Players can pick up items |
| **Damage Flags** |||
| `fall_damage` | true | Fall damage applies |
| `environmental_damage` | true | Environmental hazards active |

### Common WarZone Uses

- PvP arenas
- Event battlegrounds
- Resource competition areas
- King of the Hill zones
- Boss fight arenas

<InfoBox variant="tip" title="Arena Design">
WarZones are perfect for designated PvP arenas. Deaths in WarZones still cause power loss by default, but this creates consequences for reckless fighting.
</InfoBox>

## Zone Management

### Creating a Zone

1. **Create the named zone:**
   ```
   /f admin zone create <safe|war> <name>
   ```
   Example: `/f admin zone create safe spawn`

2. **Claim chunks for the zone:**

   Stand in each chunk and run:
   ```
   /f admin zone claim <name>
   ```

   Or use radius claiming:
   ```
   /f admin zone radius <name> <radius> [circle]
   ```

### Radius Claiming

Claim multiple chunks efficiently:

**Square radius:**
```
/f admin zone radius spawn 5
```
Claims an 11×11 chunk area (5 chunks in each direction from center).

**Circular radius:**
```
/f admin zone radius spawn 5 circle
```
Claims a circular area with 5-chunk radius.

<InfoBox variant="info" title="Radius Calculation">
A radius of N creates a square of (2N + 1) × (2N + 1) chunks, or a circle inscribed within that area.
</InfoBox>

### Managing Zones

**Remove a single chunk from current position:**
```
/f admin zone unclaim
```

**Delete an entire zone:**
```
/f admin zone delete <name>
```
This removes the zone definition and unclaims all its chunks.

**List all zones:**
```
/f admin zone list
```

**List zones by type:**
```
/f admin zone list safe
/f admin zone list war
```

<InfoBox variant="warning" title="Immediate Effect">
Zone changes take effect immediately. Players in the area will be subject to new rules instantly.
</InfoBox>

### Modifying Zone Flags

**Via Admin GUI:**
```
/f admin
```
Navigate to **Zones** → Select zone → **Configure Flags**

<InfoBox variant="info" title="Screenshot Needed">
**Screenshot:** `admin-zones.png`

**Description:** Admin zone management interface showing zone list and flag configuration

**Key elements to capture:**
- Zone list with safe/war indicators
- Flag toggle interface
- Radius claim controls
</InfoBox>

## Zone Priority

Zone rules override faction claims:

```
SafeZone > WarZone > Faction Claim > Wilderness
```

<InfoBox variant="warning" title="Priority Override">
If a chunk is marked as a SafeZone, previous faction claims are effectively suspended. SafeZone rules apply regardless of prior ownership. The faction still "owns" the claim, but zone rules take precedence.
</InfoBox>

## Visual Indicators

Zones appear on the faction map with distinct markers:

| Zone Type | Color | Map Symbol |
|-----------|-------|:----------:|
| SafeZone | Bright Green | **S** |
| WarZone | Bright Red | **W** |
| Your Faction | Your Color | **F** |
| Enemy | Red | **E** |
| Ally | Green | **A** |
| Neutral | Yellow | **N** |
| Wilderness | Gray | **.** |

Use `/f map` to see zone boundaries visually.

## Zone Storage

Zone data is stored in:

```
mods/com.hyperfactions_HyperFactions/zones.json
```

This file contains all named zones with their chunk lists and flag configurations.

## Strategic Zone Placement

### Server Spawn

Create a SafeZone around spawn:

1. Create the zone: `/f admin zone create safe spawn`
2. Use radius: `/f admin zone radius spawn 3 circle`
3. Consider a buffer zone around the core area

<InfoBox variant="tip" title="Spawn Buffer">
Consider creating a small SafeZone buffer around spawn exits to prevent spawn camping. A 2-3 chunk radius usually works well.
</InfoBox>

### PvP Arena

Create a WarZone for dedicated PvP:

1. Build your arena structure
2. Create zone: `/f admin zone create war arena`
3. Mark arena chunks: `/f admin zone radius arena 2`

### Resource Areas

Consider WarZones for contested resources:

- Encourages PvP conflict over valuable areas
- Creates natural PvP hotspots
- Building disabled prevents griefing

### Market/Trading Areas

Create SafeZones for trading:

1. Create zone: `/f admin zone create safe market`
2. Claim the trading area
3. Players can trade safely without PvP risk
4. Consider enabling `container_use` if you have shop NPCs
