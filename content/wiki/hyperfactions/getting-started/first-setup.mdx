# First Setup

This guide walks you through creating your first faction, claiming land, and inviting members.

<InfoBox variant="danger" title="Important: Permissions Required">
Before players can use factions, you **must configure permissions**. As of v0.3.0, HyperFactions denies all access by default. See [Step 0](#step-0-configure-permissions) below.
</InfoBox>

## Step 0: Configure Permissions

Before anyone can create or join factions, server administrators must grant the required permissions.

### Using HyperPerms

Run these commands to grant default players access to all standard faction features:

```
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.use
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.faction.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.member.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.territory.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.teleport.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.relation.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.chat.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.info.*
```

<InfoBox variant="warning" title="Required Permission">
The `hyperfactions.use` permission is **required** for any faction access. Without it, players cannot use any `/f` commands.
</InfoBox>

For detailed permission information, see the [Permissions Reference](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/reference/permissions).

## Creating Your First Faction

### Step 1: Create a Faction

Use the create command with your desired faction name:

```
/f create MyFaction
```

<InfoBox variant="info">
Faction names must be 3-24 characters and can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
</InfoBox>

Congratulations! You're now the **Leader** of your new faction.

### Step 2: Open the Faction GUI

Access the main faction interface:

```
/f
```

or

```
/f menu
```

This opens the interactive GUI where you can:
- View faction statistics
- Manage members
- Access the chunk map
- Configure faction settings

## Claiming Your First Territory

### Step 3: Claim Land

Stand in the chunk you want to claim and run:

```
/f claim
```

<InfoBox variant="tip" title="Chunk Size">
Each claim covers one chunk (16x16 blocks). You can see chunk boundaries by pressing F3+G in most clients.
</InfoBox>

### Step 4: View the Map

Open the chunk management GUI to see your territory:

```
/f map
```

The map shows a 15x15 chunk grid with your claims highlighted in your faction color.

### Step 5: Set Your Faction Home

While standing where you want your faction's home to be:

```
/f sethome
```

Now faction members can teleport here with `/f home`.

## Inviting Members

### Step 6: Invite a Player

To invite someone to your faction:

```
/f invite PlayerName
```

The invited player will receive a notification and can accept with:

```
/f accept
```

<InfoBox variant="info">
Invitations expire after a configurable time (default: 5 minutes). The player must accept before it expires.
</InfoBox>

### Step 7: Manage Members

As the Leader, you can:

**Promote to Officer:**
```
/f promote PlayerName
```

**Demote to Member:**
```
/f demote PlayerName
```

**Kick a Member:**
```
/f kick PlayerName
```

## Understanding Roles

Your faction has three roles with different permissions:

### Leader (You)
- Full control over the faction
- Set faction home
- Promote/demote members
- Transfer leadership
- Disband faction
- Manage all diplomatic relations
- Configure faction territory permissions

### Officer
- Invite new players
- Kick Members (not Officers)
- Manage diplomatic relations
- Claim/unclaim territory
- Use overclaim

### Member
- Claim territory (with permission)
- Use faction home
- View faction info
- Participate in chat

## Setting Up Diplomacy

### Ally Another Faction

To form an alliance:

```
/f ally OtherFaction
```

The other faction's leader must also run `/f ally YourFaction` to confirm.

**Allied factions get:**
- No friendly fire between members
- Shared land access (if configured)
- Alliance chat communication

### Declare an Enemy

To mark a faction as an enemy:

```
/f enemy OtherFaction
```

**Enemy factions:**
- Full PvP enabled
- Can be overclaimed (if enabled)
- Marked in red on maps

## Customizing Your Faction

### Set a Description

```
/f desc This is our faction's description!
```

### Set a Faction Color

```
/f color #FF5500
```

The color appears on maps and in chat.

### Open/Close Membership

**Allow anyone to join:**
```
/f open
```

**Require invitations:**
```
/f close
```

### Configure Territory Permissions

Factions can configure what actions are allowed in their territory:

```
/f permissions
```

This opens a GUI where Leaders (and Officers if allowed) can toggle 11 different flags:
- `pvp_enabled` - Allow PvP in territory
- `friendly_fire` - Allow faction members to damage each other
- `build_allowed` - Allow building in territory
- `container_access` - Allow container access
- `interact_allowed` - Allow interactions (doors, buttons, etc.)
- `item_drop` - Allow item dropping
- `item_pickup` - Allow item pickup
- `mob_spawning` - Allow mob spawning
- `mob_damage` - Allow mob damage
- `hunger_loss` - Allow hunger drain
- `fall_damage` - Allow fall damage

## Next Steps

Now that you have a faction:

1. Learn about the [Power System](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/concepts/power-system) that controls how much land you can claim
2. Understand [Territories](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/concepts/territories) for strategic land control
3. Set up [Diplomacy](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/concepts/diplomacy) with other factions
4. Review all [Commands](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/commands/basic) for complete control
5. Check the [Permissions Reference](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/reference/permissions) to understand access control
