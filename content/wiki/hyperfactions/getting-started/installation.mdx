# Installation

This guide will walk you through downloading and installing HyperFactions on your Hytale server.

## Requirements

Before installing HyperFactions, ensure you have:

- **Hytale Server** (Early Access)
- **Java 25** or higher
- **Recommended:** [HyperPerms](/plugins/hyperperms) for permission management

<InfoBox variant="warning" title="Permission Setup Required">
HyperFactions requires explicit permission grants. Without a permission manager like HyperPerms, players will be unable to use faction commands. See [Permission Setup](#permission-setup) below.
</InfoBox>

## Download

Download the latest version of HyperFactions from one of these sources:

- **GitHub Releases:** [github.com/HyperSystemsDev/HyperFactions/releases](https://github.com/HyperSystemsDev/HyperFactions/releases)
- **CurseForge:** [curseforge.com/hytale/mods/hyperfactions](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/hyperfactions)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Stop Your Server

Before installing any mods, make sure your Hytale server is stopped. Type `stop` in the server console or use your hosting panel's stop button.

### 2. Install the Mod

Copy the `HyperFactions-x.x.x.jar` file to your server's `mods` folder:

```
your-server/
├── mods/
│   └── HyperFactions-0.4.3.jar  ← Place here
├── config.json
├── universe/
├── logs/
└── HytaleServer.jar
```

### 3. Start Your Server

Start your Hytale server. HyperFactions will automatically generate its configuration files on first run.

For instructions on starting your Hytale server, see the official [Hytale Server Manual](https://support.hytale.com/hc/en-us/articles/45326769420827-Hytale-Server-Manual).

### 4. Permission Setup

<InfoBox variant="danger" title="Critical Step">
HyperFactions requires explicit permission grants. Without proper permissions, players cannot access any faction commands.
</InfoBox>

**Using HyperPerms (Recommended):**

Run these commands from the console or as an operator:

```
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.use
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.faction.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.member.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.territory.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.teleport.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.relation.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.chat.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.info.*
```

This grants all standard faction features to the default group.

For detailed permission information, see [Permissions Reference](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/reference/permissions).

### 5. Verify Installation

Once the server is running and permissions are configured, verify the installation:

```
/f help
```

If you see the HyperFactions help menu, the installation was successful!

<InfoBox variant="info">
On first run, HyperFactions creates its data directory at `mods/com.hyperfactions_HyperFactions/` with default configuration.
</InfoBox>

## Data Directory Structure

After installation, HyperFactions creates the following structure:

```
mods/com.hyperfactions_HyperFactions/
├── config.json               ← Main configuration
├── config/                   ← Module configurations
│   ├── backup.json           ← Backup settings
│   ├── chat.json             ← Chat formatting settings
│   ├── debug.json            ← Debug options
│   ├── economy.json          ← Economy integration settings
│   └── faction-permissions.json  ← Default faction territory permissions
├── backups/                  ← Automatic and manual backups
├── factions/                 ← Per-faction data files
│   └── {uuid}.json
├── players/                  ← Player power & preferences
│   └── {uuid}.json
└── zones.json                ← SafeZone and WarZone definitions
```

## Troubleshooting

### Mod Not Loading

If HyperFactions doesn't appear to load:

1. Check server logs for errors
2. Verify you're using Java 25 or higher
3. Ensure the JAR file is in the correct `mods` folder
4. Make sure the file isn't corrupted (re-download if needed)

### Commands Not Working

If `/f` commands don't work:

1. Verify the mod loaded (check server startup logs)
2. **Check permissions** - Ensure you have the `hyperfactions.use` permission
3. Try `/faction` or `/hf` as alternatives
4. Confirm HyperPerms or your permission system is configured

### Permission Denied Errors

If you see "Permission denied" messages:

1. Verify `hyperfactions.use` is granted to your group
2. Check that all required permission categories are granted
3. Use `/hp player info <player>` to verify permissions
4. See [Permissions Reference](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/reference/permissions) for the full list

## Updating HyperFactions

To update to a new version:

1. Create a backup using `/f admin backup create pre-update`
2. Stop your server
3. Replace the old JAR with the new one
4. Start your server
5. Run `/f admin reload` if prompted

<InfoBox variant="tip">
HyperFactions includes a built-in backup system. Use `/f admin backup create` before updates to create a named backup you can restore with `/f admin backup restore` if needed.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox variant="info">
HyperFactions also checks for updates automatically and notifies you when new versions are available.
</InfoBox>

## Next Steps

Now that HyperFactions is installed:

1. [Configure the mod](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/getting-started/configuration) to match your server's needs
2. [Set up your first faction](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/getting-started/first-setup) to test functionality
3. Review the [Permissions Reference](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/reference/permissions) for complete access control
