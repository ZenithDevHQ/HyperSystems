# Installation

This guide will walk you through downloading and installing HyperFactions on your Hytale server.

## Requirements

Before installing HyperFactions, ensure you have:

- **Hytale Server** (Early Access)
- **Java 21** or higher
- **Optional:** [HyperPerms](/plugins/hyperperms) for enhanced permission control

<InfoBox variant="tip">
HyperFactions automatically integrates with HyperPerms when installed. No additional configuration required!
</InfoBox>

## Download

Download the latest version of HyperFactions from one of these sources:

- **GitHub Releases:** [github.com/HyperSystemsDev/HyperFactions/releases](https://github.com/HyperSystemsDev/HyperFactions/releases)
- **CurseForge:** Coming soon

## Installation Steps

### 1. Stop Your Server

Before installing any mods, make sure your Hytale server is stopped.

```bash
# If using a control panel, use the Stop button
# If running manually, use Ctrl+C or the stop command
```

### 2. Install the Mod

Copy the `HyperFactions-x.x.x.jar` file to your server's `mods` folder:

```
your-server/
├── mods/
│   └── HyperFactions-0.2.0.jar  ← Place here
├── config/
├── world/
└── server.jar
```

### 3. Start Your Server

Start your Hytale server. HyperFactions will automatically generate its configuration files on first run.

```bash
java -jar server.jar
```

### 4. Verify Installation

Once the server is running, verify the installation:

```
/f help
```

If you see the HyperFactions help menu, the installation was successful!

<InfoBox variant="info">
On first run, HyperFactions creates its data directory at `plugins/HyperFactions/` with default configuration.
</InfoBox>

## Data Directory Structure

After installation, HyperFactions creates the following structure:

```
plugins/HyperFactions/
├── config.json              ← Main configuration
├── data/
│   ├── factions/            ← Per-faction data files
│   │   └── {uuid}.json
│   ├── claims.json          ← Global claims registry
│   ├── safezones.json       ← SafeZone definitions
│   ├── warzones.json        ← WarZone definitions
│   └── players/             ← Player power & preferences
│       └── {uuid}.json
```

## Troubleshooting

### Mod Not Loading

If HyperFactions doesn't appear to load:

1. Check server logs for errors
2. Verify you're using Java 21 or higher
3. Ensure the JAR file is in the correct `mods` folder
4. Make sure the file isn't corrupted (re-download if needed)

### Commands Not Working

If `/f` commands don't work:

1. Verify the mod loaded (check server startup logs)
2. Ensure you have the `hyperfactions.use` permission
3. Try `/faction` or `/hf` as alternatives

## Next Steps

Now that HyperFactions is installed:

1. [Configure the mod](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/getting-started/configuration) to match your server's needs
2. [Set up your first faction](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/getting-started/first-setup) to test functionality
