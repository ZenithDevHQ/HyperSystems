# Defending Territory

Territory is the foundation of faction power. Losing claims means losing your base, your resources, and your faction's home. This guide covers how to defend what you've built.

<InfoBox variant="info" title="For All Faction Members">
Defense is everyone's responsibility. Leaders strategize, but every member's actions affect faction security.
</InfoBox>

## Understanding the Threat

Your territory can be lost through:

| Threat | How It Works | Prevention |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Overclaiming** | Enemy takes your claims when power is low | Maintain power buffer |
| **Claim Decay** | Inactive factions lose claims automatically | Stay active |
| **Admin Action** | Server staff intervenes | Follow server rules |

### The Overclaim Mechanic

Enemies can overclaim your territory when:

```
Your Current Claims × Power Per Claim > Your Total Faction Power
```

**Example:**
- You have 50 claims × 2 power/claim = need 100 power
- Your faction has 80 power (after deaths)
- You're **20 power short** = vulnerable to overclaim

<InfoBox variant="danger" title="Raidable State">
When vulnerable, ANY enemy can claim your chunks by standing in them and using `/f overclaim`. You'll lose the chunk instantly.
</InfoBox>

## Power Buffer Strategy

The key to defense is maintaining a **power buffer** - excess power beyond your minimum claim requirements.

### Calculating Your Buffer

```
Buffer = Total Faction Power - (Claims × Power Per Claim)
```

### Recommended Buffer Levels

| Risk Level | Buffer | When to Use |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Minimum** | 10% | Peaceful server, no enemies |
| **Standard** | 20% | Normal play, occasional conflict |
| **War Footing** | 30%+ | Active enemies, frequent PvP |

### Example Calculation

**Your Faction:**
- 10 members × 20 max power = 200 potential power
- Currently at 180 power
- 70 claims × 2 = 140 power required
- Buffer: 180 - 140 = **40 power (28% buffer)**

This is a healthy buffer for normal operations.

## Preventing Power Loss

### Death Prevention

Each death costs 1 power (default). Minimize deaths by:

1. **Avoid unnecessary fights**: Pick your battles
2. **Travel safely**: Use home teleport, stay in friendly territory
3. **Group activities**: Don't venture alone into danger
4. **Know when to run**: Fleeing isn't cowardice, it's tactics

### Combat Logging Prevention

Logging out while combat tagged costs additional power:
- Don't panic-quit when attacked
- Fight, flee, or wait out the tag
- Combat tag is only 15 seconds (default)

### Member Management

| Member Type | Power Impact | Action |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Active, skilled | High power | Retain |
| Active, learning | Good power | Train |
| Inactive | Low/zero power | Warn, then remove |
| Reckless | Loses power constantly | Counsel, then remove |

<InfoBox variant="warning" title="Inactive Members">
Inactive members who leave suddenly take their power with them, potentially making you vulnerable. Monitor activity and remove truly inactive players.
</InfoBox>

## Early Warning Systems

### Watch for These Signs

| Warning Sign | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| Enemy faction recruiting | Building power for attack |
| Claims appearing near you | Positioning for raid |
| Your members being killed | Power reduction attack |
| Unusual player activity | Scouting your territory |
| Alliance forming against you | Coordinated threat |

### Intelligence Gathering

- Check `/f info` on potential enemies regularly
- Monitor their power relative to yours
- Track their ally network
- Note their online activity patterns

## During an Attack

### When Enemies Strike

1. **Assess the situation**: How many attackers? Who?
2. **Alert your faction**: Call for help
3. **Protect core claims**: Prioritize important chunks
4. **Minimize deaths**: Don't feed them power
5. **Call allies**: If you have them, use them

### Tactical Retreat

Sometimes you can't win. Retreat wisely:
- Unclaim non-essential territory yourself (denies them easy wins)
- Consolidate around your core
- Rebuild power before re-engaging

### Recovery After Attack

If you lost territory:
1. Stop the bleeding - minimize further losses
2. Assess what was lost
3. Rebuild power through safety and patience
4. Reclaim when ready
5. Learn from what happened

## Defensive Base Design

### Location Matters

Good defensive locations:
- Natural barriers (cliffs, water)
- Limited approach routes
- Not adjacent to enemy territory
- Room to expand defensively

### Claim Layout

**Core Claims**: Your most important territory
- Faction home
- Storage areas
- Main buildings

**Buffer Claims**: Expendable outer territory
- First line of defense
- Absorbs initial overclaims
- Less critical structures

### Building for Defense

While HyperFactions doesn't protect building contents directly, smart building helps:
- Hide valuables in less obvious locations
- Spread resources across multiple areas
- Build escape routes
- Create defensive chokepoints

## Alliance Defense

### Mutual Defense Pacts

Discuss with allies:
- When will you help each other?
- How quickly can you respond?
- What resources will you share?
- How will you coordinate?

### Coordinated Defense

When allies are attacked:
- Respond quickly if agreed
- Attack the attacker's territory
- Provide reinforcements
- Share intelligence

## War Preparation

### Before Conflict

Prepare your faction:
- Maximize everyone's power
- Verify ally commitments
- Stock emergency resources
- Establish communication plans
- Identify your critical claims

### War Resources

Keep reserves of:
- Combat equipment
- Healing items
- Teleportation aids
- Emergency supplies

### Communication Plan

During conflict:
- Who makes tactical decisions?
- How do you coordinate?
- What's the rally point?
- How do you call for help?

## Recovery Strategies

### After Losing Territory

1. **Don't panic**: Rebuilding is possible
2. **Stabilize**: Stop active losses
3. **Regenerate**: Wait for power to recover
4. **Reassess**: What can you realistically hold?
5. **Rebuild**: Start reclaiming when ready

### Rebuilding Power

Speed up recovery by:
- Ensuring all members are online and safe
- Avoiding risky activities
- Waiting for natural regeneration
- Recruiting new members (carefully)

### Reclaiming Lost Territory

When ready to reclaim:
- Start from your strongest position
- Don't overextend again
- Verify your buffer is healthy
- Consider if the lost territory is worth the risk

## Defensive Checklist

### Daily Checks

- [ ] Faction power status (`/f info`)
- [ ] All members accounted for
- [ ] No new enemy claims nearby
- [ ] Buffer at acceptable level

### Weekly Checks

- [ ] Member activity review
- [ ] Inactive member warnings/removals
- [ ] Ally relationship status
- [ ] Enemy faction power levels
- [ ] Claim efficiency review

### Before Going Offline

- [ ] Power buffer is healthy
- [ ] Officers or active members online
- [ ] No immediate threats
- [ ] Home claim is secure

## Common Defense Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Ignoring Power

**Problem:** Not monitoring power until it's too late.

**Solution:** Check `/f info` regularly. Set a mental threshold.

### Mistake 2: Solo Adventures

**Problem:** Members dying alone in dangerous territory.

**Solution:** Coordinate activities, use buddy system.

### Mistake 3: No Buffer

**Problem:** Operating at maximum claims with no safety margin.

**Solution:** Always maintain at least 20% buffer.

### Mistake 4: Slow Response

**Problem:** Not reacting to attacks quickly enough.

**Solution:** Establish alert systems and response protocols.

### Mistake 5: Hoarding Claims

**Problem:** Claiming more than you need or can defend.

**Solution:** Only claim what serves a purpose.

## Summary

Defense comes down to three principles:

1. **Maintain Power Buffer**: Never operate at the edge
2. **Minimize Deaths**: Every death weakens you
3. **Stay Vigilant**: Watch for threats before they strike

With consistent attention to these principles, your faction can weather any storm.
