# Diplomacy Strategy

Relations between factions shape the server's political landscape. Knowing when to ally, declare enemies, or maintain neutrality can mean the difference between thriving and extinction.

<InfoBox variant="info" title="For Faction Leaders">
Diplomatic decisions should be made by Leaders or designated diplomats. Major relation changes can significantly impact your faction's future.
</InfoBox>

## Understanding Relations

HyperFactions has four relation states:

| Relation | Effect | Map Color |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **OWN** | Your faction | Your color |
| **ALLY** | Friendly, protected | Green |
| **NEUTRAL** | Default state | Yellow |
| **ENEMY** | Hostile, can overclaim | Red |

### Ally Benefits

- **No friendly fire**: Cannot damage allies (unless server allows)
- **Ally chat**: Private communication channel
- **Map visibility**: See ally territory clearly
- **Mutual defense**: Common expectation to help each other

### Enemy Consequences

- **Overclaiming**: Can take enemy territory when they're weak
- **No restrictions**: Full PvP enabled
- **Reputation**: Server knows you're hostile
- **Potential retaliation**: They can raid you too

## When to Ally

### Good Reasons to Ally

| Reason | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Shared enemy** | Combined strength against a threat |
| **Geographic neighbors** | Reduces border tension |
| **Complementary strengths** | They have what you lack |
| **Mutual protection** | Safety in numbers |
| **Economic partnership** | Resource sharing |

### Warning Signs Before Allying

- Faction has history of breaking alliances
- Leadership is unstable
- Their enemies will become your enemies
- Significant size/power mismatch
- Conflicting long-term goals

### Alliance Process

1. **Initial contact**: Reach out to their leadership
2. **Discussion**: What do both sides expect?
3. **Agreement**: Terms of the alliance
4. **Formalize**: Both sides use `/f ally <faction>`
5. **Announce**: Tell your members

<InfoBox variant="tip" title="Alliance Requests">
Alliance requires mutual agreement. Send a request with `/f ally <faction>`, and they must accept with the same command.
</InfoBox>

## When to Enemy

### Declaring Enemy: Strategic Reasons

| Reason | Situation |
|--------|-----------|
| **Land conflict** | They're blocking your expansion |
| **Aggression** | They attacked you or your allies |
| **Overclaim opportunity** | They're weak and have territory you want |
| **Political necessity** | Your ally's enemy |
| **Revenge** | They betrayed you |

### Before Declaring Enemy

Ask yourself:
1. Can you actually win this conflict?
2. Do you have the power buffer to sustain losses?
3. Are your allies ready?
4. What's your exit strategy?
5. Is the potential gain worth the risk?

### The Enemy Declaration

```
/f enemy <faction>
```

<InfoBox variant="warning" title="No Take-Backs">
Declaring enemy is instant and unilateral - you don't need their agreement. But you also can't immediately undo it. Think before you act.
</InfoBox>

### Managing Active Enemies

Once at war:
- **Monitor their power**: Watch for overclaim opportunities
- **Coordinate attacks**: Don't fight alone
- **Protect your claims**: Maintain your power buffer
- **Control information**: What do they know about you?

## Staying Neutral

### Benefits of Neutrality

- No commitments to defend others
- Freedom to trade with everyone
- Avoid getting dragged into conflicts
- Build strength quietly
- Keep options open

### When Neutrality Works

- **Early game**: Build strength before committing
- **Server conflict**: Wait to see who wins
- **Geographic isolation**: No immediate threats
- **Resource focus**: Prefer building over fighting

### Strategic Neutrality

Being neutral doesn't mean being passive:
- Build relations with multiple factions
- Position yourself as valuable to all sides
- Trade information carefully
- Be ready to pick a side if needed

## Diplomatic Tactics

### Building Relationships

Before formal alliance:
1. **Informal cooperation**: Help each other occasionally
2. **Communication**: Regular contact with leadership
3. **Trust building**: Small commitments before big ones
4. **Shared activities**: Joint events or projects

### Reading Intentions

Watch for these signals from other factions:

| Signal | Possible Meaning |
|--------|------------------|
| Claiming near you | Expansion or aggression |
| Recruiting your members | Undermining you |
| Sudden silence | Planning something |
| Helping your enemy | About to turn on you |
| Frequent contact | Seeking alliance |

### Negotiation Tips

- Know what you want before negotiating
- Understand what they want
- Be willing to compromise
- Put agreements in writing (out of game)
- Define terms clearly

## Managing Alliance Networks

### Alliance Limits

Server default allows **10 allies** maximum.

| Allies | Network Type |
|--------|--------------|
| 1-2 | Tight partnership |
| 3-5 | Small coalition |
| 6-10 | Major alliance bloc |

### Coalition Politics

In alliance networks:
- **Hub factions**: Allied to many, high influence
- **Peripheral factions**: Fewer allies, less committed
- **Bridge factions**: Connect otherwise separate groups

### Alliance Obligations

Common expectations (discuss with your allies):
- Mutual defense when attacked
- Sharing intelligence
- Not allying with their enemies
- Coordinating major decisions

## Breaking Relations

### Ending an Alliance

**Peaceful end:**
1. Communicate your reasons
2. Agree to part ways
3. Use `/f neutral <faction>`
4. Maintain professional relations

**Betrayal end:**
- One side attacks without warning
- Serious breach of trust
- May lead to enemy declaration

<InfoBox variant="warning" title="Reputation Matters">
How you end alliances affects future diplomacy. Backstabbers struggle to find new allies.
</InfoBox>

### De-escalating Enemies

To end hostilities:
1. **Ceasefire**: Stop active attacks
2. **Communication**: Open dialogue
3. **Terms**: What would satisfy both sides?
4. **Agreement**: Peace treaty terms
5. **Reset**: Both use `/f neutral <faction>`

## Server Politics

### Understanding the Landscape

Map the server's factions:
- Who's allied with whom?
- Who are the major powers?
- What conflicts are active?
- Where are power vacuums?

### Power Balancing

On healthy servers, factions balance against dominant powers:
- Alliances form against the strongest faction
- Weaker factions band together
- No single faction dominates indefinitely

### Your Position

Consider where you fit:
- **Top faction**: Expect coalitions against you
- **Strong faction**: Pick your allies carefully
- **Medium faction**: Valuable ally to either side
- **Small faction**: Seek protection through alliance

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Many Enemies

**Problem:** Declaring enemy on everyone you dislike.

**Solution:** Pick battles strategically. You can't fight everyone.

### Mistake 2: Weak Alliances

**Problem:** Allied with factions who won't actually help you.

**Solution:** Test alliances with small requests before counting on them.

### Mistake 3: Inflexible Diplomacy

**Problem:** Never changing positions even when situation changes.

**Solution:** Re-evaluate relations as circumstances evolve.

### Mistake 4: Emotional Decisions

**Problem:** Declaring enemy out of anger.

**Solution:** Sleep on major diplomatic decisions.

### Mistake 5: No Exit Strategy

**Problem:** Starting wars with no plan to end them.

**Solution:** Know what victory looks like before you begin.
