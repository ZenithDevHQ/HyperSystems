# Growing Your Faction

You've established your faction and secured your first territory. Now it's time to grow. This guide covers recruitment, territory expansion, and managing a larger organization.

<InfoBox variant="info" title="For Faction Leaders">
This guide assumes you've already created a faction and claimed initial territory. If you're just starting, see [Starting a Faction](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/guides/starting-faction) first.
</InfoBox>

## Growth Phases

Factions typically grow through distinct phases:

| Phase | Size | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Startup** | 1-3 members | Survival, basic claims |
| **Establishing** | 4-10 members | Building, recruiting |
| **Growing** | 11-25 members | Expansion, alliances |
| **Mature** | 26+ members | Influence, politics |

Each phase requires different strategies.

## Recruitment Strategies

### Finding Quality Members

Not all recruits are equal. Look for:

**Positive Signs:**
- Active players (online regularly)
- Good reputation on the server
- Skills that complement your faction
- Mature behavior
- Interest in your faction's goals

**Red Flags:**
- Faction-hopping history
- Drama with previous factions
- Demanding special treatment
- Refusing to follow rules
- Inactive after joining

### Recruitment Methods

**Passive Recruitment:**
1. Keep faction open for easy joins
2. Build impressive visible structures
3. Maintain good server reputation
4. Let your members recruit friends

**Active Recruitment:**
1. Scout promising factionless players
2. Personal invitations
3. Offer specific roles (builder, fighter, etc.)
4. Recruit from disbanded factions

### The Interview Process

For larger factions, interview candidates:

1. **Initial Chat**: Get to know them
2. **Expectations**: Explain your rules
3. **Trial Period**: Guest status before full membership
4. **Full Membership**: After proving themselves

<InfoBox variant="tip" title="Trial Members">
Consider creating an informal "trial member" system where new recruits prove themselves before getting full trust and permissions.
</InfoBox>

## Territory Expansion

### When to Expand

Expand territory when you have:
- **Power surplus**: More power than needed for current claims
- **Active members**: People to use and defend new territory
- **Purpose**: A reason to claim (resources, defense, aesthetics)

### Expansion Patterns

**Contiguous Growth:**
```
Expand outward from your core in connected chunks.
```
- Easier to defend
- Clear borders
- No isolated claims

**Strategic Outposts:**
```
Claim valuable locations away from your main territory.
```
- Access to resources
- Harder to defend
- Risk of overclaim if power drops

**Border Fortification:**
```
Create a ring of claims around your core territory.
```
- Buffer against enemies
- Absorbs first attacks
- Costs extra power

### Managing Claim Limits

The claim formula:
```
Max Claims = floor(Total Faction Power / Power Per Claim)
```

| Scenario | 10 Members @ 20 Power | 20 Members @ 20 Power |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Total Power | 200 | 400 |
| Max Claims (÷2) | 100 | 200 |
| Recommended | 80 (20% buffer) | 160 (20% buffer) |

<InfoBox variant="warning" title="Growth Trap">
Don't recruit just for power. Inactive members who leave or die in PvP can suddenly make you vulnerable to overclaiming.
</InfoBox>

## Organizational Structure

### Role Distribution

As you grow, distribute responsibilities:

| Role | Responsibilities | Promoted to Officer? |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| **War Leader** | Combat coordination | Yes |
| **Builder Lead** | Base development | Optional |
| **Recruiter** | Finding new members | Yes |
| **Diplomat** | Alliance relations | Yes |
| **Treasurer** | Treasury management, deposits/withdrawals | Yes |

### Chain of Command

```
Leader
├── Senior Officers (2-3)
│   └── Officers (varies)
│       └── Members
└── Specialized Roles
```

**Leader Responsibilities:**
- Final decisions
- Officer appointments
- Alliance decisions
- Faction direction

**Officer Responsibilities:**
- Day-to-day management
- Member supervision
- Territorial claims
- Recruitment

### Communication

Establish communication channels:
- In-game faction chat for quick messages
- External chat (Discord, etc.) for planning
- Regular meetings for major decisions
- Clear announcement system

## Alliance Building

### When to Ally

Good times to seek alliances:
- When you share a common enemy
- For mutual protection
- To access shared resources
- During server conflicts

### Choosing Allies

Look for factions with:
- Similar activity times
- Compatible goals
- Good reputation
- Reliable leadership
- Geographic proximity (or strategic distance)

### Alliance Maintenance

Alliances require work:
- Regular communication with ally leadership
- Joint activities (events, defense)
- Clear boundaries and expectations
- Conflict resolution processes

See [Diplomacy Strategy](/plugins/hyperfactions/wiki/guides/diplomacy-strategy) for more on managing relations.

## Managing Growth Challenges

### The 10-Member Threshold

Around 10 members, factions face new challenges:

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Communication breakdown | Establish clear channels |
| Conflicting goals | Define faction direction |
| Resource disputes | Create sharing rules |
| Leadership bottleneck | Delegate to officers |

### Dealing with Inactivity

Inactive members drain power potential. Handle them by:

1. **Prevention**: Set activity expectations upfront
2. **Monitoring**: Track who's active
3. **Warnings**: Contact inactive members
4. **Removal**: Kick truly inactive players

<InfoBox variant="tip" title="Activity Policy">
Consider a policy like "offline 14+ days without notice = removal" and communicate it to all members.
</InfoBox>

### Managing Conflict

Internal conflict increases with size:

**Between Members:**
1. Let them resolve it privately first
2. Officer mediation if needed
3. Leader decision as final resort
4. Remove problem players if necessary

**Between Officers:**
1. Private leadership discussion
2. Clear responsibility boundaries
3. Leader makes final call

## Faction Culture

### Establishing Identity

Strong factions have clear identity:
- **Name and theme**: What do you stand for?
- **Values**: What behaviors do you expect?
- **Goals**: What are you working toward?
- **Style**: PvP-focused? Builders? Traders?

### Traditions and Events

Build faction culture through:
- Weekly events (raids, builds, contests)
- Celebration of milestones
- Member recognition
- Shared projects

## Growth Metrics

Track your faction's health:

| Metric | Target | How to Check |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Active members | 70%+ online weekly | Observation |
| Power efficiency | 90%+ of max | `/f info` |
| Claim utilization | 70-80% of max | `/f info` |
| Member satisfaction | Low turnover | Track departures |

### When Growth Stalls

If growth plateaus:
1. **Audit your reputation**: How are you perceived?
2. **Check activity**: Are current members engaged?
3. **Evaluate location**: Is your territory desirable?
4. **Review leadership**: Are officers effective?
5. **Consider rebranding**: Sometimes a fresh start helps

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall: Growing Too Fast

**Problem:** Accepting everyone leads to chaos.

**Solution:** Maintain standards even when growing. Quality over quantity.

### Pitfall: Leadership Burnout

**Problem:** Doing everything yourself as leader.

**Solution:** Delegate! Trust your officers and let them lead.

### Pitfall: Overexpansion

**Problem:** Claims outpace your ability to use or defend them.

**Solution:** Only claim territory you'll actually use.

### Pitfall: Ignoring Culture

**Problem:** Focus on numbers, neglect what makes your faction special.

**Solution:** Regularly reinforce your faction's identity and values.
