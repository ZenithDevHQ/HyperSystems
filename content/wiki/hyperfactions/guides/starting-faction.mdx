# Starting a Faction

Ready to lead your own faction? This guide covers everything you need to know to create, name, and establish your new faction on the server.

<InfoBox variant="info" title="For Players">
This guide is for players who want to create and lead their own faction. If you'd rather join an existing faction, check the faction browser with `/f` and request to join one.
</InfoBox>

## Prerequisites

Before creating a faction, ensure you:

1. **Have the permission**: You need `hyperfactions.faction.create`
2. **Are not in a faction**: Leave your current faction first with `/f leave`
3. **Have a name in mind**: 3-24 characters, alphanumeric

## Creating Your Faction

### Step 1: Choose a Name

Your faction name is your identity. Choose wisely:

**Good Names:**
- Memorable and unique
- Easy to spell and say
- Reflects your faction's theme or goals
- 3-24 characters

**Avoid:**
- Names too similar to existing factions
- Offensive or inappropriate names
- Extremely long names (hard to type)
- Names that are just numbers

### Step 2: Create Command

```
/f create <name>
```

Example: `/f create Phoenix`

<InfoBox variant="tip" title="Success!">
When created, you become the **Leader** of your new faction. You start with your personal power (default: 10) contributing to the faction.
</InfoBox>

### Step 3: Customize Your Faction

After creation, customize your faction identity:

**Set a Tag (short name for chat):**

Open the settings GUI with `/f settings` and navigate to the Tag section. Tags are 1-5 alphanumeric characters that appear in chat (e.g., "PHX" for Phoenix).

**Set a Description:**
```
/f desc <description>
```
Example: `/f desc A rising faction dedicated to exploration and adventure.`

**Set Your Color:**
```
/f color <color>
```
Example: `/f color #FF6600`

<InfoBox variant="info" title="Colors">
Colors can be hex codes (#FF6600) or named colors (orange, blue, red, etc.). Your color appears on the map and in chat.
</InfoBox>

## Your First Territory

With your faction created, it's time to claim your first territory.

### Choosing a Location

Consider these factors when choosing your base location:

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Resources** | Near valuable resources or biomes |
| **Defense** | Natural barriers, chokepoints |
| **Accessibility** | Not too far from spawn for recruiting |
| **Neighbors** | Distance from other factions |
| **Expansion** | Room to grow your claims |

### Claiming Your First Chunk

1. Stand in the chunk you want to claim
2. Run: `/f claim`
3. The chunk is now your faction's territory

<InfoBox variant="tip" title="Power Check">
With starting power of 10 and power-per-claim of 2, you can claim up to **5 chunks** as a solo player. Don't overclaim early!
</InfoBox>

### Setting Your Home

Set your faction home for easy return:

```
/f sethome
```

Members can then teleport here with `/f home`.

<InfoBox variant="warning" title="Claim Your Home First">
You can only set home in territory you own. Claim the chunk first!
</InfoBox>

## Recruiting Members

A one-person faction is vulnerable. Start recruiting!

### Making Your Faction Discoverable

**Option 1: Open Faction**
```
/f open
```
Anyone can join without invitation. Good for rapid growth, risky for security.

**Option 2: Closed Faction (Invite Only)**
```
/f close
```
Players must be invited or request to join. More secure, slower growth.

### Inviting Players

Find trustworthy players and invite them:
```
/f invite <player>
```

They have 5 minutes to accept with `/f join <your-faction>`.

### Handling Join Requests

If closed, check incoming join requests in the GUI (`/f` → Members → Requests) or watch for chat notifications.

Accept requests from players you trust.

## Early Game Strategy

### Power Management

As a new faction, power is your most precious resource:

| Action | Power Impact |
|--------|--------------|
| New member joins | +10 (their starting power) |
| Member reaches max | +20 potential |
| Member dies | -1 per death |
| Member leaves | Lose their power |

**Early Priorities:**
1. Don't claim more than you can defend
2. Minimize risky activities (PvP while weak)
3. Let power regenerate before expanding

### Claim Strategy

Start conservative:

1. **Core Claims First**: Claim your base and essential areas
2. **Buffer Later**: Add defensive buffer once you have power
3. **Don't Spread Thin**: Concentrated claims are easier to defend

**Power Buffer Rule:**
```
Safe Claims = (Total Power / Power Per Claim) - 2
```
Keep 2 claims worth of power as a safety buffer.

### Avoiding Early Conflicts

New factions are vulnerable. Avoid:
- Claiming near established factions
- Aggressive behavior toward neighbors
- Making enemies before you're ready
- Overexpanding into contested areas

## Building Your Team

### Member Quality vs Quantity

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Many Members** | More power, faster growth | Hard to manage, potential drama |
| **Few Trusted** | Tight-knit, loyal | Slower growth, vulnerable |

For new factions, **quality over quantity** is usually better. A few active, loyal members beats many inactive ones.

### Promoting Officers

As you grow, promote trusted members to Officer:
```
/f promote <player>
```

Officers can:
- Invite new members
- Kick members
- Claim and unclaim territory

### Setting Expectations

Establish faction rules early:
- Activity expectations
- Combat rules (when to fight/flee)
- Resource sharing policies
- Chain of command

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Overexpanding

**Problem:** Claiming too much territory with too little power.

**Solution:** Follow the power buffer rule. Only claim what you can defend.

### Mistake 2: Wrong Location

**Problem:** Setting up too close to aggressive factions or in undesirable areas.

**Solution:** Scout the area first. Use `/f map` to see who's nearby.

### Mistake 3: Inviting Everyone

**Problem:** Accepting every join request leads to trust issues and drama.

**Solution:** Be selective. Talk to potential members first.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Defense

**Problem:** Beautiful base with no thought to protection.

**Solution:** Build with defense in mind. Walls, chokepoints, escape routes.

### Mistake 5: Making Enemies Too Early

**Problem:** Picking fights before you're ready.

**Solution:** Stay neutral until you have the power to back up your words.

## First Week Checklist

## Growing Beyond Startup

Once established, focus on:
