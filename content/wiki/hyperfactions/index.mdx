## Key Features

### Faction Management
Create and manage factions with unique names, customizable colors, and a three-tier role hierarchy (Leader, Officer, Member). Features smart invitation system, join requests, activity logging, and configurable member limits.

### Territory System
Chunk-based claiming with visual feedback, integrated world map with terrain imagery mode, power-based claim limits, and anti-fragmentation protection. Supports multi-world/dimension claiming with map visibility filtering.

### Power System
Personal power per player that contributes to faction power. Automatic regeneration, death penalties, kill rewards, and power cost per claim create balanced strategic gameplay.

### Diplomatic Relations
Form alliances for mutual protection and shared land access, declare enemies to enable full PvP and overclaiming, or maintain neutral relations with other factions.

### Economy & Treasury
Faction treasury system with deposits, withdrawals, and inter-faction transfers. Full transaction logging and configurable permissions. Integrates with VaultUnlocked for server economy support.

### Combat & Protection
Combat tagging prevents logout exploitation. Block placement, breaking, container protection, and granular interaction controls keep your territory secure. Allied access is configurable per-permission.

### Territory Permissions
Factions can configure 25 different flags to control what happens in their territory, including PvP, mob spawning, building, container access, keep inventory, and more. Four flags require OrbisGuard-Mixins for advanced features.

### GUI-Based Management
Full graphical interface for managing factions, viewing maps with terrain imagery, configuring settings, managing treasury, browsing chat history, and handling admin tasks.

### Automatic Backups
Built-in backup system with GFS (Grandfather-Father-Son) rotation policy. Create manual backups or let the system handle it automatically.

### Chat Integration
Toggle-based faction and alliance chat channels. Cycle between normal, faction, and ally chat modes with `/f c`. Configurable formatting, tag display, and relation-based colors with persistent chat history.

### Integrations
HyperFactions integrates with several optional plugins:
- **HyperPerms / LuckPerms** - Permission management
- **VaultUnlocked** - Server economy for treasury features
- **OrbisGuard-Mixins** - Advanced zone flags (keep inventory, invincible items, NPC spawning, F-key pickup)
- **Gravestones** - Gravestone access control in zones
