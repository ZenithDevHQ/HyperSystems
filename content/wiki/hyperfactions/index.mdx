## Key Features

### Faction Management
Create and manage factions with unique names, customizable colors, and a three-tier role hierarchy (Leader, Officer, Member). Features smart invitation system, activity logging, and configurable member limits.

### Territory System
Chunk-based claiming with visual feedback, integrated world map display, power-based claim limits, and anti-fragmentation protection. Supports multi-world/dimension claiming.

### Power System
Personal power per player that contributes to faction power. Automatic regeneration, death penalties, and power cost per claim create balanced strategic gameplay.

### Diplomatic Relations
Form alliances for mutual protection and shared land access, declare enemies to enable full PvP and overclaiming, or maintain neutral relations with other factions.

### Combat & Protection
Combat tagging prevents logout exploitation. Block placement, breaking, and container protection keeps your territory secure. Allied access is configurable.

### Territory Permissions
Factions can configure 11 different flags to control what happens in their territory, including PvP, friendly fire, building, container access, mob spawning, and more.

### GUI-Based Management
Full graphical interface for managing factions, viewing maps, configuring settings, and handling admin tasks.

### Automatic Backups
Built-in backup system with GFS (Grandfather-Father-Son) rotation policy. Create manual backups or let the system handle it automatically.

### Chat Integration
Custom faction and alliance chat channels with configurable formatting, tag display, and relation-based colors.
